      A Step-by-Step Tutorial</h1>
      <blockquote>
      <p>This section familiarizes you with
      creating a particle effect from scratch with a step-by-step procedure. If
      you&#8217;re already familiar with the process and need more specific
      information, skip this section. Creating your own bitmaps and plugging
      them into the particle editor is described later in this document. This
      procedure uses the example bitmaps provided with the editor, and the
      resulting effect is available as one of the example files (well,
      almost...). But now, let&#8217;s get into the tutorial.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Creating a Fire Effect</h2>
      <blockquote>
      Start ParticleFX and create a new effect by clicking the New
      button. A new document window appears.
      <p>It&#8217;s handy to have something in the background of the preview
      scene to see how large the effect is. Click the &lt;none&gt; button next
      to &#8220;KF Scene&#8221;, and browse into the Examples \
      Backgrounds directory. Select grid.txt and press OK. This puts a
      translucent grid with 1 meter squares into the preview scene.
      </p><p>Now you need to create a Particle. Select &#8220;Particle&#8221;
      from the selector under the &#8220;Element and Emitter properties&#8221;
      then click the New button in the lower left corner of the window.
      This creates a new Particle and opens the properties window for it.
      </p><p>The particle is named &#8220;Unnamed Particle&#8221; as default.
      Change the name into something appropriate, like &#8220;Flames&#8221;.
      </p><p>First off, your particle needs a bitmap. Click the Import
      button under &#8220;Particle Bitmaps&#8221;. A file browser opens. Go to
      the &#8220;Bitmaps&#8221; directory under the directory where you&#8217;ve
      installed ParticleFX, and open the bitmaps.txt file.
      </p><p>The bitmaps.txt file has several particle bitmaps plugged in. A
      selector appears. Select the reelflames_additive one (the second
      lowest in the list) and click OK. The &#8220;Reel Flames&#8221; are a set
      of flame bitmaps captured from real flame footage. There are 6 sequences
      in total, each consisting of a different number of bitmaps. (If there
      are several &#8220;containers&#8221; in one particle bitmap set,
      ParticleFX automatically randomizes between the bitmap sets. This gives
      the particles variety. A particle effect can appear artificial if all the
      particles look identical.)
      </p><p>OK, the particle now has a bitmap, so it can be previewed. Skip
      this step and move to the next step if you can hold your curiosity for a
      little while. However, if you can&#8217;t wait to see what the effect
      looks like at this point, select Emitter from the Element and
      Emitter properties then click the New button to create a new Particle
      Emitter. After that, go to Emission Control, and click New to
      create a new emission, select &#8220;Flames&#8221; and the emitter you
      just created (&#8220;Unnamed Particle Emitter&#8221;) from the pop-up
      window and press OK. Press F2 to view the effect. You see a
      fountain of flame-like glowing, repetitively looping blobs spewing out of
      the emitter. Doesn&#8217;t look like flames? Of course not. There&#8217;s
      still a lot of tweaking to do. Close the preview by pressing F4.
      </p></blockquote>
      <p align="center"><img src="step-by-step_tutorial_files/step-b1.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027" height="238" width="318"><br>
      <i>This is what the results should look like with a flame bitmap and
      default parameters applied</i></p>
      <blockquote>
      First off, you need to change some of the particle&#8217;s
      properties. Go back to the Particles section of the Element and Emitter
      properties, and double-click on the Flames particle to open it up.
      Here&#8217;s what you need to do:
      <p>Change the Animation type to Lifetime.
      The flame bitmaps consist of sequences where a few different flames die
      away, so they should not loop.
      </p><blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>      Ignore the animation FPS and random
      1st frame properties, as they only apply to looping bitmap
      sequences.
              </p></li><li>
                <p>      Set the Particle Random Rotation
      from &#8211;180 degrees to 180 degrees. This randomizes the
      particles&#8217; on-screen rotation by 360 degrees, giving the flames
      further variety. Also check the Randomize rotation direction
      checkbox.
                </p></li><li>
                  <p>Check the Random mirroring X and Y
      checkboxes. The particle bitmaps will now be randomly mirrored by both
      axes, to give further variety to the particles.
                  </p></li><li>
                    <p>Flames tend to travel upwards. Change the
      flame&#8217;s Gravity multiplier to &#8211;2.5. It&#8217;s a
      good idea to use negative gravity instead of directed emission. This
      ensures that the flames always travel upwards regardless of the
      orientation of the emitter.
                    </p></li><li>
                      <p>Change the Air Resistance (El.
      Velocity) to Cubic. This increases the flames&#8217; air
      resistance when they gain velocity, preventing them from flying up way too
      fast.
                      </p></li><li>
                        <p>Change Air Resistance (El. Size)
      to Linear. (With this particular effect though, the size-related
      air resistance has little effect).
                        </p></li><li>
                          <p>Set the Air Resistance Constant to
      4. Flames should have a reasonable amount of air resistance.</p>
                          </li>
                          </ul>
      </blockquote>
      Try previewing the effect now, and see what
          happens. A tower of flames flying upwards. Looks better, but still not
          quite there! Let&#8217;s do some further tweaking with the particle
          before moving to the emitter. Click the Size Graph  button, and
          edit the graph to look something like this:
      </blockquote>
      <p align="center"><img src="step-by-step_tutorial_files/step-b2.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1028" height="199" width="319"></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Since the graph is not very detailed, drop its sample rate to 8. The
          graph dictates that the particles will start from zero size, then grow
          up to size 1 (full size), and towards the end of their life cycle,
          shrink a little.
        </p>
        Click the Rotation Graph button, and edit the graph to look
      like this:
      </blockquote>
      <p align="center">
          <img src="step-by-step_tutorial_files/step-b3.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1029" height="199" width="319"></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
      This makes the particles to rotate at a constant speed from &#8211;187
      degrees to 0 degrees. The &#8220;Randomize Rotation Direction&#8221;
      checkbox randomly flips this graph for different particles for variety (the
      emitter&#8217;s Rotation Multiplier also affects the particles&#8217;
      rotation, we&#8217;ll get into that later). Again, since the graph is
      only a straight line, you can reduce its sample rate to 2.</p>
        Next, click the Vertex Alpha Graph and edit it to look like
      this:
      </blockquote>
      <p align="center">
          <img src="step-by-step_tutorial_files/step-b4.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1030" height="200" width="320"></p>
      <blockquote>
      Because the flame bitmap sequences don&#8217;t have that many frames, this
      helps to smooth out the last frames where the flame dies out.
        <p>Finally, click the RGB Color Graph button, and edit the
      graph to look like this:
      </p></blockquote>
      <p align="center">
          <img src="step-by-step_tutorial_files/step-b5.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1031" height="199" width="319"></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
      Just if you want to be fancy. This fades the flames&#8217; color towards
      red as they die out.</p>
      <p>All right! You&#8217;ve created
        a working flame particle! If you preview the effect now, it looks like a
        flame tower, and it still leaves a lot to be desired:
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="center"><img src="step-by-step_tutorial_files/step-b6.jpg" v:shapes="_x0000_i1032" height="238" width="318"></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>You see, particles alone
        don&#8217;t make the effect. The Emitter also needs to be tweaked
        carefully, because the Emitter has a lot of influence on how the
        particles behave.</p>
      </blockquote>
        <h2>Tweaking the emitter</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The next thing to do is to start
        tweaking the Emitter you created. Select Particle Emitter from
        the Element and Emitter properties and double-click the &#8220;Unnamed
        Particle Emitter&#8221; to open its properties window.</p>
            <p>The emitter needs a better name. Change it to something
      appropriate, like &#8220;Flaming&#8221;.
            </p><p>Since the flames travel upwards on their own, emission direction is
      not needed at this time. Leave the Direction graph unedited (except
      maybe dropping its sample rate to 2).
            </p><p>Just for the hell of it, also leave the Emission Random Velocity
      graph as it is. As default, the flames get tiny random velocity
      variation, but not much. Reduce the graph&#8217;s sample rate to 2.
            </p><p>Now let&#8217;s move to the Emitter Shape section. The flames
      probably look best when emitted from a flat plane. Change the Geometry
      under Emitter Shape to Square.
            </p><p>Set the minimum and maximum values for X to &#8211;0.15 and 0.15
      meters. Leave the Y min and max values to 0. Set the minimum and maximum
      values for Z to &#8211;0.15 and 0.15 meters. This creates a flat square 30
      by 30 centimeter plane inside which all the particles are generated. The
      origo of the effect is in the center of the plane.
            </p><p>The
flame effect we&#8217;re working on is constant, and meant to loop
indefinitely. Set the Cycle length to 20 seconds, and edit the Emission
Rate graph so that the upper graph is at roughly 80 and the lower graph
roughly at 10. This is easiest to do by dragging the graphs up and down
with the right mouse button. It doesn&#8217;t matter which line is higher and
which lower. Since the graphs are used only for constant values this
time (ie. horizontal lines), reduce their sample rate to 2. The
particle effect will now run for 20 seconds after started, and emits 10
to 80 particles per time unit. Check the Cycle Looping checkbox.
Particle effects can be either looped by checking this checkbox, or set
to &#8220;looping&#8221; in the scripts (these details will be covered in other
documentation). </p><p>Edit the Element Lifetime Graph so that the upper line is
      roughly at 1 and the lower line is roughly at 0.3. Again, drop the sample
      rate to 2. As a result, the emitted particles will have a lifetime between
      0.3 and 1 seconds throughout the 20-second cycle.
            </p><p>Edit the Size Multiplier Graph so that the upper line is
      roughly at 0.9 and the lower line roughly at 0.4. The particles&#8217;
      size will be randomized between 0.4 and 0.9 units throughout the cycle.
            </p><p>As with the above graphs, edit the Rotation Multiplier Graph
      to 0.2 and 0.6. This way, some flames will rotate less, some more. A
      rotation multiplier of 1 has no effect on the particle&#8217;s rotation
      graph; values larger than 1 increase the rotation, and positive values
      smaller than 1 reduce it.
            </p><p>Try previewing the flames. Looks
      much better now, doesn&#8217;t it?
      </p></blockquote>

      </p><blockquote>
      <p>The example file provided is
      actually a combination of two flame effects. The original emitter was
      cloned with the Clone button and edited a little. The first emitter spews
      smaller flames with a bit shorter lifetime, and the other one spews larger
      flames with a longer lifetime. This was done to prevent the smallest
      flames from flying too high up, which happens if you try to emit all
      flames from one emitter with a lot of size variation. This can result in
      very long-living, small flames if you&#8217;re not careful.</p>
      <p>You may have noticed that the
      example fire effect that came with ParticleFX also contains a pillar of
      rising smoke. As an exercise, try to re-create the smoke from scratch.
      Here&#8217;s some pointers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The
          smoke bitmap provided with the example files is very bright in itself.
          Use the Color Graph to darken it.</li>
          <li>Smoke
          fades out smoothly. Ramp down the Vertex Alpha Graph. Since the smoke
          bitmap is quite opaque, you can start the opacity graph at an already
          low value and go down from there.</li>
          <li>Smoke
          rises upwards, but slower than flames. Use a smaller negative gravity
          multiplier.</li>
          <li>Smoke
          clouds tend to live a lot longer than flames. Random Element Lifetime
          from 2 to 5 seconds should be fine. Because of their long lifetime,
          they should be emitted at a lower rate to prevent excessively dense
          smoking.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Another interesting exercise
      could be to change the fire effect into a fireball-style explosion. Change
      the flame cycle&#8217;s length to 10 seconds, then give the Emission Rate,
      Size and Lifetime graphs more resolution, and make the effect first emit a
      lot of very large, long-living flames, then ramp the values down. As a
      result, the fire should start with a blast, then burn away until the
      flames go out. Here&#8217;s how to change the graphs:</p>
