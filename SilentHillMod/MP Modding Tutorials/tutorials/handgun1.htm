                  <P>In this tutorial, I'll be guiding you through the process 
                  of creating a simple weapon in 3D Studio Max 5. It's not going 
                  to be beautiful, and I don't really have too much time at my 
                  mates place to fiddle with Max5... but it will give you an 
                  insight into the workings of basic modelling and texturing... 
                  You should <SPAN class=kcm>NOTE: this tutorial will ONLY cover 
                  BASIC modelling and TEXTURING. Bones and animation for weapons 
                  will be a whole new tutorial, likewise there will be a 
                  separate tutorial for implementing your weapons...</SPAN></P>
                  <P>Before I begin, I'd like to share a couple of tips with you 
                  and basically... these are common sense game modding tips, any 
                  designer or 3D artist will know this stuff already but let me 
                  just remind you...</P>
                  <UL>
                    <LI>Keep your poly-count to an absolute minimum, but don't 
                    be tight with detail (<SPAN class=hl>800-1000</SPAN>) 
                    <LI>Most details on your model can be textured instead of 
                    modelled, i.e. ridges and bumps 
                    <LI>Save your work progress continuously under sequential 
                    filenames "gun1", "gun2", "gun3" 
                    <LI>Don't leave texturing to the last minute, texture half 
                    way through so you can see how it looks 
                    <LI>With circular shapes, <SPAN class=hl>stick with octagons 
                    (8 sides) or LESS</SPAN>, use shading/smoothing to help! 
                    <LI>Don't forget to triangulate your model to help the 
                    geometry export </LI></UL>
                  <P>Naturally, for this tutorial you <SPAN class=hl>WILL</SPAN> 
                  need a copy of <SPAN class=hl>3D Studio Max version 5</SPAN> 
                  <I>with the plug-ins</I> from the Remedy Max Payne 2 Developer 
                  pack. I also really hope you have some knowledge of 3D Studio 
                  Max. As usual I have been patronising to the very, very, very 
                  last letter *cough*, so hopefully near complete n00bs to 
                  3DsMax5 will know what I'm ranting on about...</P>
                  <P>For this tutorial, I am not providing a HOIME pack since I 
                  know my weapon will get ripped off and used in some mod no 
                  matter how good or bad it looks. Instead I am providing the 
                  base image I'm using to create my weapon from... which you 
                  should also use to follow this tutorial...</P>

                  <P><SPAN class=hl>I will also warn you that this is a LONG ASS 
                  tutorial, if you don't have the patience or time to commit to 
                  it, then I suggest leaving it for the time being and getting a 
                  "3DsMax5 for dummies" book.</SPAN></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>Intro.</SPAN> Ok, first things first is 
                  to grab that image I linked above, or an image of the weapon 
                  you'd like to model. I recommend a left facing image of the 
                  weapon you want laying flat. This gives you the starting point 
                  you need to begin modelling your weapon. Ok, so open up 3D 
                  Studio Max 5, and then <SPAN class=hl>select the VIEW 
                  menu</SPAN> at the top of the screen, find and <SPAN 
                  class=hl>select "Viewport background"</SPAN>. You should have 
                  a dialog like this come up...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic1.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>1.</SPAN> This setup is simple, and it 
                  will basically let you place an image as the viewport 
                  background (makes things easy to work with). So, <SPAN 
                  class=hl>CLICK</SPAN> the <SPAN class=hl>"Files" button 
                  (1)</SPAN>, and then <SPAN class=hl>select the image 
                  file</SPAN> you want to use for your weapon. Make sure <SPAN 
                  class=hl>"Match Bitmap" (2) is selected</SPAN>, this will 
                  ensure that the image is never stretched or contorted. <SPAN 
                  class=hl>Select "Display Background" (3)</SPAN>, and <SPAN 
                  class=hl>Lock Zoom/Pan (4)</SPAN>. Ensure that <SPAN 
                  class=hl>"Active Only" (5) is selected</SPAN>, otherwise all 
                  the other viewports get the background too. Also you want to 
                  work from the <SPAN class=hl>"Top" viewport</SPAN>, not the 
                  front or left or right etc... so make sure it's selected (6). 
                  Finally, once you are done, <SPAN class=hl>press "Ok" 
                  (7)</SPAN>. You're screen should look like this...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic1_1.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>2.</SPAN> Now, let's start with 
                  modelling the weapon. I chose the Glock 18c for this tutorial 
                  since it's such a blocky weapon, doesn't require too much 
                  modelling detail, and it's a commonly used weapon throughout 
                  the US armed forces, military etc... so it's easily recognised 
                  in a game. Before you begin, what I recommend doing is <SPAN 
                  class=hl>maximizing the top viewport</SPAN>, the simplest way 
                  to do this is to <SPAN class=hl>select/click inside the TOP 
                  viewport</SPAN> (it will have a yellow border), then <SPAN 
                  class=hl>CLICK the "Min/Max" toggle button</SPAN> in the 
                  bottom right hand corner of the screen...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic2.jpg" 
border=0></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>3.</SPAN> Ok, done that? NOW we do some 
                  modelling, cuz' I lied in the step above... I guess I'm just 
                  "jumping the gun" (har har har). Ok, so for real now... <SPAN 
                  class=hl>select from the creation panel "shapes"</SPAN>. If 
                  you are a complete n00b with 3DsMax, then the creation panel 
                  is the complex looking panel on the top right hand side of the 
                  screen, just below the toolbar. You want to <SPAN 
                  class=hl>CLICK on the FIRST tab</SPAN> (which has an mouse 
                  pointer icon)... then <SPAN class=hl>CLICK the button with 3 
                  shapes</SPAN> on it (next to the button with the sphere icon). 
                  Now you are read to create some <SPAN class=hl>SPLINES</SPAN>; 
                  so <SPAN class=hl>select LINE</SPAN>, now you can move to the 
                  next step... If you are still puzzled by what the freakin 
                  shix0r I've just done, look at the image below... Start from 
                  the first red circle and work your way down...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic3.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>4.</SPAN> Now this is the fun part (but 
                  mommy? isn't it ALL fun? - haha, no. Wait till you get to 
                  editing the text files <IMG class=blank alt=:P 
                  src="handgun1_file/blah.gif" align=top>). Ok, so you may have 
                  already guessed, but we're going to draw an outline of the 
                  gun. <SPAN class=hl>NOT</SPAN> the top part, just the base. 
                  Basically we are excluding the barrel, the breach, the 
                  finger/trigger guard, and the trigger. Have a look at the 
                  image below to see what I mean... so basically, you are 
                  outlining the part in green, the rest will be done separately 
                  later on - the reason for this is that 1. the breach part will 
                  need to move back and forth when shooting, 2. the finger guard 
                  is thinner than the base of the gun so it would look clunky 
                  and odd if we modelled it now. 3. The trigger again is smaller 
                  than the base. And 4. The muzzle or barrel will be revealed 
                  when the breach moves back.</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic4.jpg"></P>
                  <P>To outline your weapon, basically <SPAN class=hl>CLICK in 
                  the TOP viewport at a starting point</SPAN> say the bottom end 
                  of the handle, then click all the way around. Now the trick 
                  here is to NOT click at every curve, kind of try to produce 
                  the shape of the gun, but in the least amount of clicks. The 
                  reason here is poly reduction, if I went around the gun in 
                  detail I could so easily end up with a shape that had 200+ 
                  sides, and when we extrude the shape and triangulate it, we'd 
                  have 700+ faces - and that results in ONE laggy mufo-ass gun 
                  (of course this is going to be Baaaaaad). A basic tip is to 
                  remember is; that a curve or corner can be produced with 3 
                  clicks, not 10. </P>
                  <P>When you have gone completely around the gun, <SPAN 
                  class=hl>CLICK back onto your starting point</SPAN> and you 
                  will be asked if you'd like to "close the spline" - <SPAN 
                  class=hl>select yes</SPAN>. When you are done, you'll have an 
                  outline which looks something like this...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic4_4.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>5.</SPAN> The next step here is to 
                  outline the other parts, again I stress that it is important 
                  to be detailed, but not so detailed that every curve, and 
                  corner is modelled freakin' super accurately. Start with the 
                  breach, then do the finger guard. LEAVE the trigger, and the 
                  barrel/muzzle alone.</P>
                  <P>When outlining the finger guard, do it so you leave some 
                  over-hang at either end... like this...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic5.jpg"></P>
                  <P>Now, as mentioned above, just outline the breach and then 
                  we'll move on to the next step. When you're done, you should 
                  have something resembling this...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic5_1.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>

                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>6.</SPAN> From the picture above you 
                  can see already that it's looking like a gun, but it's just a 
                  pile of shitty lines until we extrude and begin tweaking it. 
                  For some of you who are really really reaaaaallly new to this 
                  shit, it will take a few attempts to get it the way you want 
                  it. It's easy to get frustrated, but if you place a point 
                  wrong or whatever you can always edit each point you placed it 
                  to make it better. Or err... start again... *DAMN YOU!!! ~

                    points, you just finish up the outline and make sure you 
                    CLOSE the spline. Now <SPAN class=hl>select/click the 
                    outline you buggered up</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=hl>select 
                    the modifiers tab...</SPAN></P>
                    <P><SPAN class=hl>6.2</SPAN> Now the next thing you need to 
                    do is select the "Vertex" item from the list. This means you 
                    can select points individually and move them around...</P>
                    <P><SPAN class=hl>6.3</SPAN> To move these "vertex" points 
                    you need to click the "MOVE" button from the toolbar, it 
                    looks like this...</P>
                    <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic6_1.jpg"></P>
                    <P><SPAN class=hl>6.4</SPAN> Now <SPAN class=hl>select the 
                    vertecies you want move</SPAN> (they are marked by little + 
                    (crosses). One you have clicked and selected one, you are 
                    free to move it anywhere you like. Below you can see I have

                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>7.</SPAN> Rock on Elvis (uh huhuh)... 
                  let's extrude this and make it come to life... but first SAVE! 
                  Instead of ordinary save, use "Save As" and rename the file 
                  "glock2" or whatever you have named it, basically now you will 
                  be working from "glock2" automatically, and glock1 is safe and 
                  sound.</P>
                  <P>To extrude; <SPAN class=hl>SELECT the main gun base 
                  outline</SPAN> and go to the <SPAN class=hl>modifiers panel 
                  (explained in step 6.1)</SPAN>, and from the <SPAN 
                  class=hl>modifiers list select "extrude"</SPAN>, you will get 
                  some new options, <SPAN class=hl>under "amount"</SPAN> enter 
                  <SPAN class=hl>"40.0"</SPAN> it's a starting size, and we can 
                  always scale it up or down if we need to later on. Do the same 
                  for all of the other shapes... except for the trigger guard, 
                  you should enter an extrude amount of <SPAN 
                  class=hl>"20.0"</SPAN> (half). Your weapon should be looking 
                  like this...</P>

                  gun I think you'd agree? The next thing to do is hide the 
                  parts we aren't working on, because things will get a little 
                  complex from here onwards (yeah right, like things aren't 
                  complex now *doh!*). <SPAN class=hl>Select the "breach" 
                  part</SPAN><B><FONT color=#ff0000> </FONT></B>(indicated 
                  purple in my picture), then <SPAN class=hl>CLICK</SPAN> the 
                  <SPAN class=hl>"display" tab</SPAN>, scroll down to "HIDE" 
                  category and then <SPAN class=hl>CLICK "hide 
                  selected"</SPAN>... have a look at the picture below...</P>

                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>9.</SPAN> Ok, now here's a tiny... 
                  little... complex thing, go <SPAN class=hl>back to the 
                  Modifiers tab</SPAN> (come on you should know what this is by 
                  now... it's the second icon at the top of the picture above). 
                  Then,<SPAN class=hl>RIGHT CLICK</SPAN> on the <SPAN 
                  class=hl>Extrude modifier</SPAN> you added earlier, you now 
                  have a popup menu... from the menu <SPAN class=hl>CLICK 
                  "Collapse to"</SPAN>, you will get a "F*CK YOU$£!£%! message 
                  box", it's ok just <SPAN class=hl>CLICK YES</SPAN> to get rid 
                  of it, the warning has no relevance here. Basically what we 
                  have done is make the mesh will absorb the modifier of 
                  "extrude" so we can mess around with it without effecting the 
                  extrude depth. REMEMBER HOW TO DO, WHAT, ERR... YOU JUST 
                  DID!</P>
                  <DIV class=hr>

                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>10.</SPAN> Ok if you thought "complex" 
                  was; 3 bisexual teens in a weird love triangle thing... then 
                  this is going to blow your mind... *cough*. Right-o, now that 
                  you've converted the base of your gun to an "editable mesh", 
                  from the same panel (modifiers), you will need to look at the 
                  list box which has the top item as "editable mesh"...<SPAN 
                  class=hl>SELECT "POLYGON".</SPAN> This will allow you to 
                  select individual faces for editing. So <SPAN class=hl>select 
                  all the forward facing faces/polys on the handle of the 
                  gun...</SPAN> (do them one at a time) like in my picture... if 
                  you find you can't select more than one poly, <SPAN 
                  class=hl>hold CTRL and click the next one...</SPAN></P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic10.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>11.</SPAN> The next step here is to do 
                  something called <SPAN class=hl>"slicing"</SPAN> this is where 
                  we literally slice the selected faces in half... (and has 
                  nothing to do with cakes or pizzas)... but why? Well it's to 
                  add some detail to our gun handle... it will help with giving 
                  that smooth and realistic look. So, from the actions panel 
                  <SPAN class=hl>select SLICE PLANE</SPAN>... look at the 
                  screenshot above, the button is on the right hand side panel 
                  midway down. Now upon clicking that you will have a yellow 
                  square/border type thing, this shows what is being cut. For 
                  the moment it's fine where it is, so just <SPAN class=hl>CLICK 
                  the SLICE button</SPAN>... you should see a change almost 
                  immediately...</P>
                  <P><SPAN class=hl>Turn OFF the slice plane by clicking the 
                  "SLICE PLANE" button again</SPAN>, now from the modifier stack 
                  (where you selected "Polygon" from)... find and <SPAN 
                  class=hl>SELECT "vertex"</SPAN>. Now the red faces should 
                  disappear and you should have some pretty looking red and blue 
                  dots (awww ain't they cute). <SPAN class=hl>Select the MOVE 
                  button</SPAN> and move these dots a tiny bit towards you... 
                  this can be more easily accomplished by placing the <SPAN 
                  class=hl>MOVE cursor over the RED arrow</SPAN> (x axis), then 
                  click and drag. But don't drag it too far out, just a 
                  little... And now your gun looks like this...</P>

                    <P>If you like you can repeat the process for the back end, 
                    but first save as "glock4" and work from 
that.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>12.</SPAN> Now, there's just a few more 
                  things we need to do to tidy this up before we can work on the 
                  breach, trigger, and trigger guard. Basically we need to think 
                  about when a gun is fired the breach moves back and reveals 
                  the barrel and also the ejection hole for the bullet. So 
                  because our breach will be moving back we need to think about 
                  these factors.</P>
                  <P>Ok, so first we'll work on the barrel part, this will be 
                  attached to the main base section it will save on detail and 
                  keep things manageable. Move the camera around to look at the 
                  top of your gun where the breach would be. Now, we need to 
                  create another slice plane, but before that, <SPAN 
                  class=hl>select "polygon"&nbsp;from the modifiers stack</SPAN> 
                  (like you did earlier), now <SPAN class=hl>select the top 
                  face</SPAN>.<SPAN class=hl>Now click SLICE PLANE</SPAN>, and 
                  then <SPAN class=hl>CLICK the ROTATE button</SPAN> (which is 
                  next to the move button on the toolbar)... Ok, stay with me 
                  now... this is easier than you think... Ok so look along the 
                  bottom of 3DsMax screen there are <SPAN class=hl>3 input boxes 
                  X, Y, and Z</SPAN>. In the <SPAN class=hl>Y box TYPE 
                  "90"</SPAN> this will rotate the slice plane so that it looks 
                  like it could chop the front end of the gun off... now <SPAN 
                  class=hl>CLICK the MOVE button</SPAN> and bring the slice 
                  plane along a tiny bit towards the front end of the gun... 
                  then click SLICE. I really freakin' hope your gun model looks 
                  like this so far... otherwise the lord knows I will get a 
                  billion e-mails about it *heheh* <IMG class=blank alt=:P

                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>13.</SPAN> Alright schveeet, looking 
                  good and no, it's not too hard from here. I'm just smacking 
                  myself because it's so difficult to explain the inner workings 
                  of 3DsMax, to people who have probably never used it before 
                  now. I'm always wondering if I need to go into more detail or 
                  whether the people who already know 3DsMax will be shouting at 
                  me for patronising them <IMG class=blank alt=:D 
                  src="handgun1_file/grin.gif" align=top></P>
                  <P>Aside from my ramble select the bit on the end you just 
                  sliced (again using <SPAN class=hl>POLYGON mode from the 
                  modifiers stack</SPAN>). Then <SPAN class=hl>turn the SLICE 
                  panel OFF</SPAN>, and now <SPAN class=hl>TURN it back ON 
                  AGAIN</SPAN> (this resets the slice plane). Now in the those 
                  boxes I mentioned earlier (X,Y,Z) in the Z box type "16" and 
                  <SPAN class=hl>press SLICE</SPAN>, type "-32" then<SPAN 
                  class=hl>press SLICE again</SPAN>, and now you have something 
                  that looks like this...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic13.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>14.</SPAN> Ok now scroll up from "Slice 
                  Panel" and there should be a button that says "extrude". It's 
                  handy at this point to make sure you have the all 4 views open 
                  so you can see how far to extrude (just click the Min/Max 
                  button)... Now this is important to note, the 2; <SPAN 
                  class=hl>UP</SPAN> and <SPAN class=hl>DOWN arrows</SPAN> next 
                  to the extrude button will create a new block/layer every time 
                  you press them, we only need to make 2 blocks/layer extensions 
                  so if you freak up, click UNDO. </P>
                  <P>Right let's do this... <SPAN class=hl>CLICK and HOLD on the 
                  UP button and drag UP</SPAN>, WATCH the model in the TOP 
                  window and stop half way to the top of the breach (on the 
                  background image)... then let go, and repeat the process once 
                  more, only this time stopping JUST underneath the top of the 
                  breach... so it looks like this...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG src="handgun1_file/pic14.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>

                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>15.</SPAN> Ok at this point You should 
                  <SPAN class=hl>SAVE</SPAN>. At this point you may need to weld 
                  some vertices, but again for this tutorial it's too complex... 
                  I don't want to go into it... also partly because I'm already 
                  on step 15 and I haven't even got to the breach or texturing 
                  yet! Welding is something you need a good logical mind for, 
                  and a bit of experience, it's something that you will need a 
                  separate mini tutorial for... and, this is a MAX PAYNE 2 
                  modding site, not teach 3D Studio Max site <IMG class=blank 
                  alt=:P src="handgun1_file/blah.gif" align=top></P>
                  <P>Anyway, from here, <SPAN class=hl>SELECT "edge"</SPAN> from 
                  the <SPAN class=hl>modifier stack</SPAN>, now select the 2 
                  shorter edges at the top of the extruded stack... then <SPAN 
                  class=hl>click the SCALE button</SPAN> (next to rotate button 
                  on the main toolbar), now <SPAN class=hl>RIGHT click this 
                  BUTTON</SPAN> and a small dialog pops up. You have 4 boxes, 3 
                  on one side and 1 alone on the other side ("world scale")... 
                  in the single box, <SPAN class=hl>TYPE "70%"</SPAN>, this will 
                  bring the top edges together and make the top of the stack 
                  sloping, but symmetrically... like this...</P>
