        <h1>Viewport Popup Menu</h1>
        <p>The viewport popup menu can be accessed by right-clicking in any of 
          the viewports (3D or 2D). The menu provides a set of options that allow 
          the current view to be altered. Below is an image showing the menu, 
          click on one of the options to see a description for that menu item.</p>

        <h2>Shading Type</h2>
        <p>Wireframe, Flat Shaded, Smooth Shaded and Textured are all shading 
          types. </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <h3><a name="Wireframe"></a>Wireframe</h3>
          <p>This shows the model as it would be composed with lines between the 
            vertices to represent the outlines of the faces of the model.</p>
          <h3><a name="Flat"></a>Flat Shaded</h3>
          <p>This shows the model with single colour flat faces to the structure. 
            In this view, individual polygons can be seen easier than in the other 
            views. </p>
          <h3><a name="Smooth"></a>Smooth Shaded</h3>
          <p>Smooth shading creates a gradient polygon when the light determines 
            the brightness of the polygon at each vertex it belongs to. This gives 
            a natural look, not possible in wireframe or flat shading.</p>
          <h3><a name="Textured"></a>Textured</h3>
          <p>This shading type is the same as smooth shading but assigned textures 
            and alphamaps are also displayed.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2><a name="Projection"></a>Projection</h2>
        <p>The projection sub menu brings up the menu shown in the image below.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><img src="Images/perspective.gif" width="78" height="125"></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This menu choice allows you to change the perspective of the camera. 
          All views listed apart from the 3D view use Orthographic projection 
          (3D uses perspective). This allows you to control which way you view 
          the object from allowing for easier modelling. This can also be changed 
          through the <a href="Panels%20&amp;%20Windows/ViewCaption.html">Viewport 
          Caption</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="ShowAxis"></a>Show Axis</h2>
        <p>This option allows you to turn the display of the 3 axis lines in the 
          centre of the view on and off. By default these lines are X = Yellow, 
          Y = Turquoise and Z = Pink. In the orthographic (2D) views there will 
          only be 2 lines displayed as the third lies on the same plane as that 
          of the camera.</p>
        <h2><a name="ShowGrid"></a>Show Grid</h2>
        <p>This option toggles on and off the display of the grid lines in the 
          viewport. This option can be used in all viewports, 3D and 2D (individually) 
          to toggles grid lines on and off.</p>
        <h2><a name="Backfaces"></a>Draw Backfaces</h2>
        <p>All faces that face inward (have a clockwise vertex order) will not 
          be displayed when this option is off. Inward facing faces are ones that 
          are completely black when flat shadin is turned on.</p>
        <h2><a name="ResetView"></a>Reset View</h2>
        <p>This menu option allows the user to reset the viewport back to the 
          default viewport settings. The defaults are the settings used when MilkShape 
          3D is started up.</p>
        <h2><a name="FrameAll"></a>Frame All</h2>
        <p>This will frame the complete model (including all polygons/groups in 
          the current workspace) into the centre of the view. This allows the 
          easy viewing of all parts of the current model, it can also be useful 
          when you are finished working on a specific part and instead of resetting 
          the view to default you can frame the entire model for a better view.</p>
        <h2><a name="FrameSelection"></a>Frame Selection</h2>
        <p>This works in much the same way as Frame All except the view is focused 
          on the current selected object/s in the workspace.</p>
        <h2><a name="Background"></a>Choose Background Image...</h2>
        <p>This allows the user to choose a background image for their model. 
          This feature is commonly used to have a reference picture from which 
          to work. This option will open a standard windows open box, choose your 
          image from the appropriate directory on disk. A background image cannot 
          be applied to a 3D (perspective) viewport.</p>
        <p>Each pixel in the background image takes up 0.25 units on the MilkShape 
          3D orthographic grid, so for example a 100 x 100 pixel image will take 
          up 25 x 25 units on the grid. The background image is always centered, 
          if the image is of even height or width then the best estimate is used.</p>
        <h2><a name="Screenshot"></a>Take Screenshot...</h2>
        <p>This menu choice will bring up a standard windows save box.The current 
          contents of the viewport can be saved in .bmp format. When using this 
          function you must type the .bmp file extension onto the end of the filename, 
          if this is not done it will be an unknown type file.</p>
        <h2></h2>
        <h2><a name="Record"></a>Record AVI...</h2>
        <p>This feature can be used to record an AVI format file of the animation 
          of the currently loaded model. The AVI will run for the entire length 
          of the frames currently specified in the <a href="Keyframer.html">Keyframer</a> 
          at the bottom of the MilkShape 3D window. If you have an animation then 
          it will be played and captured in the AVI file, if there is not animation 
          then you will just get a still model, i.e. no animation or movement.</p>
        <h2><a name="Maximise"></a>Maximize</h2>
        <p>This feature simply toggles the viewport between maximised and minimised. 
          When maximised the viewport takes up the space that all viewports would 
          have taken up.</p>
