        <p>In the infamous words of Jerry Maguire.</p>
        <p>This is the final version of the MilkShape 3D help file. It is final 
          in the sense that it is up to date with the current version of MilkShape 
          3D and that all the sections I intended in including are all here.</p>
        <p>However, its rarely that simple, especially with computer orientated 
          things. So all I ask you is: if you find any errors in this Help file 
          please report them to me. If you find spelling mistakes they will not 
          warrant an entirely new release but will instead be included in bigger 
          changes and increments of the help file.</p>
        <p>As new releases of MilkShape 3D appear I will release new versions 
          of the help file if I think that a new feature is particularly difficult 
          to understand.</p>
        <p>I am also open to suggestions, so send all error reports and questions 
          to sckoobs@yahoo.com. I check this address daily so you should recieve 
          a reply within a day or so, as long as I'm not particularly snowed under.</p>
