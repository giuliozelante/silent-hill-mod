            justice to by reading books and browsing the net, this section only 
            serves as a basis from which to work in MilkShape 3D and understand

          <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Basics of 3D<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
          <p>3D Space is represented by 3 planes or dimensions (hence 3-Dimensional). 
            These are the X, Y and Z planes. Y Ranges in the up and down directions, 
            X in the left and right and Z in the depth. Y is the height, X is 
            the width and Z is the depth.</p>

          <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Constructs of 3D<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
          <p>There are many different building blocks available in the area of 
            3D. High-end 3D applications allow the use of Splines, Curves, NURBS 
            (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines), etc... MilkShape 3D deals with the 
            basics that are widely supported on numerous Graphics Cards and Graphics 
            Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) such as DirectX and OpenGL. 
            The basic building blocks MilkShape 3D deals with are Polygons, Vertices 
            and Normals.</p>
          <h3><span style='font-family:Arial'>Vertices<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
          <p>A Vertex is the simplest construct, it is a point in 3D space, which 
            has an X, Y and Z coordinate value. In MilkShape 3D vertices can be 
            placed and used to define a polygon (triangle) and are represented 
            by a dot.</p>

          <h3><span style='font-family:Arial'>Polygons<o:p></o:p></span></h3>
          <p>The word 'polygon' can mean a lot of things to many people. In generic 
            terms a Polygon is a flat surface with either three sides (triangle) 
            or four sides (quad). MilkShape 3D uses only triangles. However in 
            3D Theory a polygon can have an infinite number of sides. As computers 
            cannot handle 'infinity', in practice the number of sides a polygon 
            can have is usually limited to three or four. In MilkShape 3D a polygon 
            (triangle) is represented by lines joining three vertices. An outward 
            (forward) facing polygon is defined counter-clockwise, an inward (backward) 
            facing polygon is defined clockwise.</p>

            <p><img src="../Images/3DTheoryPractice/Triangle.gif" width="154" height="170"></p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>By definition a Polygon is a convex shape, there are no concave areas 
            around its edge. The following image shows a variety of valid and 
            non-valid polygons.</p>

          <p>As a rule of thumb, a shape with any side which would intersect any 
            other side, if an infinite line was projected from it, is a non-valid 
            polygon. All of these shapes can be made in MilkShape 3D using triangles, 
            the Non-Valid shapes would be valid as they would be composed of triangles 
            which are themselves Valid polygons. However, as single polygons (i.e. 
            not composed of other Valid polygons) the Non-Valid polygons are still 
            Non-Valid, that is; not a polygon.</p>
          <h3><st1:City><st1:place><span style='font-family:Arial'>Normal</span></st1:place></st1:City><span
  style='font-family:Arial'><o:p></o:p></span></h3>
          <p>A normal is basically a vector, that is; a straight line. It is defined 
            by a start point and an end point, both of which are points in 3D 
            space (meaning they have an X, Y and Z coordinate value). In a 3D 
            object only one vertex is needed per normal as the vertex the normal 
            is<span style='mso-ansi-language:
  EN-GB'> <span lang=EN-GB>attached</span></span> to defines the start position 
            for the normal.</p>
          <p>Normals are used to determine how a polygon is lit by the light sources 
            around it. A normal (in Flat Shading) can be imagined to project from 
            the middle of the polygon at a 90 degree angle to the surface of the 
            polygon. The normal always faces from the side of the polygon looking 
            outward.</p>
          <p>Graphics Hardware will calculate the intensity of the light on the 
            surface of the polygon by using the normal. The intensity depends 
            on how close the angle of the normal is to the angle of the light, 
            e.g. if the normal is perpendicular (on the same angle) with the angle 
            of the light, this is the point at which the intensity of the light 
            on the polygon is brightest. If the normal is facing away from the 
            light direction then this will be the point at which the intensity 
            of the light is at its darkest.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>This image shows the different light intensities on the surface of 
            the model. Each side is composed of four triangles, so strictly speaking 
            there should be a black line (representing a normal) originating from 
            the centre of each triangle upwards in a 90 degree angle to the surface 
            of the polygon. In this demonstration though, we can deduce that because 
            the light intensity is the same for each side (the four triangles) 
            the normals are also the same i.e. they are equal. In MilkShape 3D 
            the light in the scene comes from the viewing perspective of the camera 
            in the scene, like a camera with a flashlight on it. The normal with 
            an angle closest to that of the light (the same position as the camera) 
            is number one; therefore the surface it is attached to is the brightest. 
            The surface that normal two is attached to is less bright as this 
            normal is facing away from the light more. Normal three is facing 
            away from the camera the most and therefore its surface is even darker.</p>

            another method of surface shading called Smooth Shading. If you have 
            switched between Smooth and Flat Shading you will have noticed that 
            polygons in Flat Shaded mode are more defined, this is due to the 
            difference in lighting methods.</p>
          <p>With Smooth Shading a normal is projected from each vertex at a 90 
            degree angle from the face it is attached to. Where a vertex is attached 
            to more than one face an average of the angles between the faces and 
            the vertex is used.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>This image shows the normals that are attached to the vertices. Vertex 
            Lighting (as it is termed) results in a Smooth finish to the surfaces. 
            This is due to an averaging of light intensity between surfaces that 
            results in a gradient, rather than a solid fill as would be achieved 
            by Flat Shading.</p>
          <p>This concept can be further explained by taking a better example. 
            In the image immediately below is a box. The right side of the image 
            is a flat shaded box therefore all normals attatched to vertices are 
            pointing in exactly the same direction as the face is pointed. By 
            Unwelding vertices (Vertex-&gt;Unweld) you create more vertices, four 
            for each face and none are shared, so in the image instead of having 
            eight vertices (as the Smooth Shaded box on the right of the image 
            does) there are 36 i.e. 12 triangle faces times 3 vertices for each 
            face = 36. The white lines show where the normals would be if a line 
            was drawn from the vertex to the normal.</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>One more thing to note is that Normals are of a unit length, i.e. 
            they are a length that is a whole number; 1, 2, etc... To<span lang=EN-GB
  style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> Normalise</span> something means to introduce 
            an equation that will make a number equal to one, that equation is 
            commonly the number divided by itself.</p>
          <p>With everything that has been said before you are probably in the 
            state if mind that Normals are lines. Well metaphorically speaking, 
            they are lines, they have a start point (the vertex it is attatched 
            to) and an end point (the normal position). But in actual fact a normal 
            is a point in space, a vector, much as a vertex is a vector. A vector, 
            if you have not heard of one before, generally speaking is a numerical 
            quantity. In 3D graphics it can be literrally described as a direction. 
            A direction is a straight line and the direction can be obtained by 
            knowing the current position and the destination position. A normal 
            therefore is a point in 3D space, a vector, 3 values x, y and z. The 
            renderer in 3D engines takes the position of the normal in relation 
            to the position of the vertex it is attatched to, in order to figure 
            out the lighting intensity the surface will have.</p>
          <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Texture Mapping<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
          <p>Texture Mapping literally means mapping a texture onto a surface. 
            In order for a texture to appear correctly on a surface UV coordinates 
            are used at each of the vertices that compose the surface. The U coordinate 
            is the Texture X coordinate and the V is the Texture Y coordinate, 
            we deal with only two dimensions as images are only two dimensions 
            (there are also 3D textures but that goes<span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> 
            <span lang=EN-GB>out with</span></span> the scope of this document).</p>
          <p>As the following image shows, imagine taking the texture and pasting 
            it on top of the surface (in this case a triangle). The coordinates 
            that the image is transposed onto the surface are stored at each vertex 
            that make up the surface.</p>
          <blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>

          </blockquote>
          <p>The bit that is not mapped to the triangle (i.e. the lower right 
            triangle of the bitmap) is cut off. UV Coordinates allow the surface 
            to have mapped any area of the applied texture the user wishes. In 
            the texture coordinate editor the vertices represent the UV coordinates 
            on the texture, on the model the texture is applied to the surface 
            using the UV coordinates.</p>
