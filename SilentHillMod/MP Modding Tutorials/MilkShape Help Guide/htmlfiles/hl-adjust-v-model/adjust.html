<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I often get asked the question, 
  &quot;how come I cant see my weapon when I choose it while playing Half Life?&quot; 
  There is a simple reason for this perplexing anomaly; &nbsp;the model is not 
  in the viewers site. It position in relation to you, or what is known as players 
  view, is set to some outside area of the game FOV, (Field Of Vision). This could 
  be below, above, left, right or behind your line of sight. So another question 
  will come up: &quot;how can I&nbsp;move it to a position where I can view it 
  ingame?&quot; Or: &quot;I have been moving this model around and still cant 
  see it, how can I know wTo help you out with this situation, I have made up 
  a Milkshape 3D file to use to help find out where the model is hiding from you. 
  You can download this file at: <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?/polycount/tutorials/rat/hl-v_origin.zip" target="_top">hl-v_origin.zip</a></font> 
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These are valid reasons 
  to pull your hair out by its roots, as you can spend&nbsp; a lot of time using 
  the trial and error method of moving the model around to be able to view it. 
  In a discussion of this nature in the chat room on #wavelength on irc.gamesnet.net, 
  I was trying to explain the method of movement from the statement that you have 
  to add to the models qc file to get it to move to a new origin, when this simple 
  solution came to mind that I am going to explain in this article. </font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> My method is a fairly simple 
  one: create some boxes with lines and numbers on them that reflect units to 
  show you what numbers to put in the $origin statement in the qc file. Lets take 
  a look at this statement and dissect it to see how it affects the models movement: 
  </font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>$origin 5 10 
  32</i></font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The word origin tells the 
  compiler to move the model to a new point in 3D space to the world that you 
  are viewing. You are the center of its universe. (Hey didn't they used to believe 
  that we were in the center of the universe back a few centuries ago?).&nbsp; 
  The origin point 0 0 0 means that you would not move it from its present position. 
  The origin points are measured in the X, Y, and Z coordinate positions in the 
  3D world of which you are part of as a player. You can see an axis similar to 
  this when your creating a model in 3D Max or Milkshape 3D. (See Figure 1.1)</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Figure 
  1.1 The Axis as viewed in Milkshape 3D</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First, you need to put my 
  <b><i>&quot;origin.ms3d&quot;</i></b> file in the same directory that you have 
  your <font color="#0000FF">&quot;v_&quot;</font> model in as well as the textures 
  that came with it to show the grid. Next, open your model in Milkshape 3D, and 
  most importantly, deselect any thing that may be selected by clicking on <u>E</u>dit-&gt;Select 
  <u>N</u>one. Next merge the <i>&quot;<b>origin.ms3d&quot;</b></i> file. (See 
  Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3). &nbsp;</font>

  </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Figure 
  1.3 Merged files</strong> </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After Merging 
  the two files, do not deselect the boxes as you will need to move them to a 
  position that matches the center of your model. If you accidentally deselect 
  them you will need to reselect only the boxes with numbering on them. Position 
  the boxes so that they will line up to the center of your weapons center position 
  like you would be viewing it in its idle position. (See Figure 1.4) </font>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img border="0" src="pics/tips-4.jpg" width="324" height="300"></font>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Figure 
  1.4 Centering guides to the v_ model</strong> </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now you will 
  want to assign the boxes to a joint that does not move around or rotates in 
  players view. My choice was Bip01 since it does not move or rotate at all. Again 
  refer to Figure 1.4 for how to choose the box vertices as they have not been 
  assigned to any joint yet and all the other vertices should already have an 
  assignment. This is done by clicking on the <b><i>&quot;Joints&quot;</i></b> 
  tab and clicking on the <b><i>&quot;Bip01&quot;</i></b> in the <b><i>&quot;Joints&quot;</i></b> 
  list. After this you will click on the <b><i>&quot;SelUnAssigned&quot;</i></b> 
  button, then click on the <b><i>&quot;Assign&quot;</i></b> button to assign 
  the vertices to this joint.</font>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A few things 
  are in order for you to do before you might be able to see these boxes ingame. 
  Position the about a body length away from your weapons foremost point. This 
  would be a normal player models length if he was laying horizontally, rather 
  than vertically. You will need to save this as your reference smd&nbsp; file. 
  Recompile your model and save this new model to the directory that you will 
  be able to view it ingame when you choose this weapon. Start HL and choose the 
  game that you need to view this weapon, then select it. You should now be able 
  to see the boxes somewhere in the field of vision, since these puppies are pretty 
  big. If you do not, then the model is way off from the line of site, including 
  the boxes. If this is the case you will need to run extra parameters in your 
  command line start up. To do this you will need to create a destop shortcut 
  like this: </font>

  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This will enable 
  you to start up HL in a the map doublecross for testing. Once you have the game 
  running, pull down the console by typing the <b><i>&quot;`&quot;</i></b> key. 
  Type <i><b>&quot;impulse 101&quot;</b></i> then <i><b>&quot;Enter&quot;</b></i> 
  to get all weapons. (Yes I know, your cheating, but someone's got to do it to 
  fix this weapon!). Select the weapon that is having the problem, and take a 
  look at the guides to see how far off you are. Take a look at Figure 1.5 to 
  see how I viewed a new weapon that I got finished making.</font>

  1.5 Badly aligned weapon at top of viewport.</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, judging from what I 
  can see in the game, I took a guess from the guides that I needed to bring the 
  weapon down about 32 units. I typed this on the Z axis portion of the $origin 
  statement that I added to my qc. file. Take a look at my qc file in figure 1.6 
  for an example. </font>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img border="0" src="pics/tips-6.jpg" width="468" height="238"></font>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Figure 
  1.6 Adding the $origin statement to the qc file.</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Looking at my qc file shows 
  that putting a <b><i>&quot;-&quot;</i></b> in front of the number where the 
  Z axis, or in the case of an UP-DOWN movement on the Z axis would make it move 
  upwardly. So I needed to type just a plain 32 which the compiler will take it 
  to mean +32. Once you figure out what numbers to type in the $origin statement, 
  save the qc file and recompile your model. Run the game from your shortcut and 
  see if your model has adjusted itself correctly like mine did as seen in Figure 
  1.7 shows.</font></p>

  1.7 Corrected v_ model.</strong> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You may need to make some 
  minor adjustments to your $origin statement so as to get your <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;v_&quot;</font> model in the right place. Once you have 
  your model in the right view area for your Half Life game, you will open up 
  the merged files and remove the grid boxes by deleting them. Then recompile 
  the model and you have yourself a brand new <font color="#0000FF">&quot;v_&quot;</font> 
  model! After using this method I have saved myself a lot of grief and hair pulling! 
  Hopefully now we can get on to making a useful <font color="#0000FF">&quot;v_&quot;</font> 
  model without the hassle of trying to find where in the world, or should I say, 
  3D world, is our model?</font></p>
