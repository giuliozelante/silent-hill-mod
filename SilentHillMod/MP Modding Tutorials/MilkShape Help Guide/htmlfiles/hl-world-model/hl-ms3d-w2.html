<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will be able to save 
  a lot of time if in advance, if you research and perhaps sketch out what you 
  are trying to accomplish for a model. If you are working with a team, you will 
  need to write down all that is expected of the model. It can be frustrating 
  if you get the usual, &quot;I don't care, just make a &lt;insert model here&gt;!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you are not going to 
  be the artist of the model you will need to get with him on the creation of 
  what you think the shadow outlines, (the flat or 2d edges of the model), are 
  going to look like. Once you think that you have what is what the team wants 
  you will have to submit it to them so they can decide if that is what is meant 
  by the description they have given you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lets say the team has decided 
  on having a knife for use ingame. And they told you that it should not be real 
  elaborate, so as to keep the lag in game play down. This would require that 
  you have a model that would be a low poly count. Well with that said and done, 
  you or your 2d artist set out to come up with something. You need to decide: 
  </font>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">will it have a hand shield? 
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">how elaborate is the 
    blades design going to be, (curves, saw blade edge, holes, etc.)? </font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">how elaborate is the 
    handle going to look, (do you really want that brass screw)? </font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once you have decided, you 
  may want to do some research to see what is already in some games, so as to 
  original. Then you might want to look in some magazines or on the web for something 
  that you have in mind. If you find a photo of one out there, then you have already 
  won half the battle of design!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The photo below was the 
  one pick to best suit our model design of the knife. We will be using it to 
  make our model by using it in the background.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this point you will be 
  starting Milkshape 3d up and setting the background image to one of the windows 
  with its view set to left, as the above picture has its view set. In the &quot;Left&quot; 
  viewport, right click and click on the Choose Background Image... on the menu 
  selection. In the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Open&quot;</font> dialog box, 
  navigate to the directory that you have set up to receive all the files to make 
  your model by clicking on the drop down list button on the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Look 
  in:&quot;</font> section. I made mine in a <em><strong>&quot;C:\WINDOWS\Desktop\models\knife2&quot;</strong></em> 
  as you can see from the directory structure of my QC file.(See Figure 1.5a). 
  You now should see the background image in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Left&quot;</font> 
  viewport, as Figure 1.6 has it in its viewport. Once you set the background 
  image, you will be able to start creating the knife. If you wish to turn off 
  the background image, just repeat the steps outlined above, but click the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Cancel&quot;</font> 
  button on the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Open&quot;</font> dialog box, and 
  it will disappear.</font></p>
