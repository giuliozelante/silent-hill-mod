<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Well 
  first off, as I was preparing to write a tutorial on modeling, I scoured the 
  net for what was all ready out there on modeling a character for use in a game. 
  What I came up with, was a truck load of information on the benefits of using 
  this or that method, and not a whole lot on telling you how to create a model. 
  Oh I am sure there are some really good ones out there, but you want it now, 
  right?<br>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This tutorial will hopefully 
  be the first of a series, starting with the basis of what is involved in the 
  process of creating a model, it's skin, skeleton and animation, all in this 
  order. As a final installment we will be showing you how, by a step by step 
  detail, to get the model into Half-Life. <br>
  What we will be making is a world model for HL, that is the things you see laying 
  on the floor in a deathmatch or the single player game that you can pick up, 
  or it may be placed there with the intent of killing you! (Take for example 
  the grenades and other types of explosives that you throw in TFC). <br>
  For this Tutorial, we will be using the popular Milkshape 3d by Mete Ciragan. 
  I plan on making a Max 3d tutorial as well. </font></p>
<h2><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What 
  is needed to complete your model</b></font></h2>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You will first off have 
  to get the Milkshape 3D program by Mete Ciragan. This can be found at the following 
  web site: <a
href="http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/index.html" target="_top">http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft/index.html</a> 
  Another program that we will be using for the extraction of Valves and other 
  add on packs and Modifications models is called Qped. You can find this at: 
  <a
href="http://www.planetquake.com/qped/" target="_top">http://www.planetquake.com/qped/</a>. 
  Also, you will need a paint program to make the &quot;skin&quot; of your model. 
  There are several out there that you can use. Some use Photoshop as a basis 
  for their creation of a &quot;skin.&quot; These tutorials will be using the 
  popular Paint Shop Pro for it creation of a &quot;skin.&quot; You can find an 
  evaluation of this program at: <a
href="http://www.jasc.com/" target="_top">http://www.jasc.com/</a>. Another program 
  that will be useful in your creation of models is the Half-Life Model Viewer 
  that can be found at: <a

  <br>
  Although it is not required it is sometime done among modelers to hand sketch 
  the model, (some even go as far as fully illustrating the model on paper first), 
  then scan this into the computer for a background to create the model by. <br>
  Below you will see and example of what I did for a mod for a health rune, that 
  was to be as detailed as most player models. I sketched out my idea and then 
  scanned it into my comp and used it for a background to create her. <br>

In this first tutorial, we will be learning how to flesh out a low polygon world 
model. I feel this is a good basis to eventually come to a point to be able to 
do character animation. You must be able to learn the basics before being able 
to create fantastic warrior models that you see in 3d games like HL. A world model 
does not do much, and its associated compiling is relatively simple using its 
qc file. A qc file stand for Quake Compile, and in this file, all the necessary 
information is kept to instruct the compiler on how to create the model for use 
in a game. We will be discussing this after we get our model ready for compilation!

You can download the completed file to view how this knife was made at: <a

You will need Milkshape Version 1.4.0 to open the Ms3d file that is contained 
in the zip, even though some of the figures show a lower version of Milkshape. 
(Hey I am to lazy to retake some screen shots in the newer version!) If you are 
reading this and a new Milkshape comes out since the writing of this tutorial 
there is a menu selection to convert an old msd3 file. <br>
<br>
To do this click on Tools->Convert Old <u>M</u>S3D File Format. <br>
