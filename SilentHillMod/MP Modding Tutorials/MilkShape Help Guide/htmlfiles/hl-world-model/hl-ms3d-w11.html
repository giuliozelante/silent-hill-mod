<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will be deleting the 
  bottom of this <strong><em>&quot;box&quot;</em></strong> so that we can continue 
  the handle and not have extra faces in out knife. Select the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Bottom&quot;</font> viewport selection in a viewport from 
  its viewport selections drop down list. You might have to right click in this 
  viewport window and select <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Reset View&quot;</font> 
  from the menu selection to get the wireframe to show up in this view, and also 
  zoom in a bit. In the the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Left&quot;</font> viewport you will be using the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Select&quot;</font> tool set to the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Face&quot;</font> 
  option and selecting all but the <em><strong>&quot;box&quot;</strong></em> that 
  you just created. Hide these faces. Next, turn on the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Ignore 
  Backfaces&quot;</font> option by clicking in the check box. Click in a blank 
  area to unselect all faces or vertices. Click inside of the box in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Bottom&quot;</font> 
  viewport of the <em><strong>&quot;box&quot;</strong></em> so that only two of 
  the bottom <em><strong>&quot;faces&quot;</strong></em> are selected. Press the 
  <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Delete&quot;</font> button on your keyboard, and 
  those unwanted faces disappear magically!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order to help us to create 
  the handle portion better, we are going to make the viewport bigger. Right click 
  in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Left&quot;</font> viewport window and click 
  on the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Maximize&quot;</font> menu selection as shown 
  in Figure 1.41. Your viewport will resize to full screen to you client window 
  of Milkshape3D. This works as a toggle, which means that in order to see all 
  your viewports again, you just do the same step as before.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zoom the viewport window 
  in until you can see the extremities of the knife handle for better creation 
  of the vertices. The creation process will be exactly the same as when we first 
  made one side of the knife blade, only this time it will be totally flat. I 
  told you it would be easier now! You may want to review the procedures in for 
  the creation of the faces. I am going to get you started by telling you that 
  you will create the outline of vertices. I will also give you a tip: 4 of the 
  vertices on each side of the knife handle have also been created for us from 
  the box that we created earlier. So you will have to align the vertices that 
  you have created to complete the outline&nbsp; to the left side of the <em><strong>&quot;box&quot;</strong></em> 
  in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Front&quot;</font> viewport. Figure 1.42 
  illustrates what you should have when done. Again review the steps from the 
  knife blades creation to accomplish this step.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next step is to Texture 
  this side. Your on your own here as well as you can review the steps that was 
  involved in the the texturing of the knife blade. You will also have to remember 
  to make a new <em><strong>&quot;group&quot;</strong></em> of faces in the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Group&quot;</font> rollout. Figure 1.43 illustrates what 
  it will look like when you have completed this operation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Wow! Looking good! Do you 
  remember the trick of duplicating one side and mirroring it to the other side. 
  Also remember to weld the puppy to the other side and texture it in the same 
  way we did the left and right blade mirror. You will then sew it up just like 
  we did on the knife blade. Please review these steps if necessary to refresh 
  your memory. I would like to explain that you will have to delete two faces 
  on the other side of the knife handle that formed part of the <strong><em>&quot;box,&quot;</em></strong> 
  as they will get in the way of our duplication. Please refer to Figure 1.44 
  to see the selected faces to be deleted. Make sure you have the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Right&quot;</font> 
  viewport available to work in to do this and have the </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The last thing that should 
  be done is to fix the textures of you handle. You might not realize this, but 
  the top portion of the <em><strong>&quot;box&quot;</strong></em> that you created 
  earlier, has no texture assigned to it and the new groups that you have created 
  will need texture added to them. First select the <em><strong>&quot;box&quot;</strong></em> 
  top, and fake a texture for it by making a region in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Top&quot;</font> 
  view of the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Texture Coordinate Editor&quot;</font> 
  like we did before. It should have a metal look. The knife handle's <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Front&quot;</font> 
  and <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Back&quot;</font> texture groups can be faked 
  as well. (Some of the more particular texture artist may take extra time to 
  &quot;paint&quot; the sides of the weapon, but we are just going to fake because 
  we can!) When your finished with the creation of the handle and textured it, 
  unhide everything by clicking the<font
color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>E</u>dit-&gt;<u>U</u>nhide All&quot;</font> in the&nbsp; 
  menu selections.</font></p>
