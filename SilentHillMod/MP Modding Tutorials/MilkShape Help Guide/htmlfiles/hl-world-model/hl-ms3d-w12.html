  game company is start to take notice of our work! I can see the paychecks now! 
  *Ahem* ..., well seriously folks, take a look at Figure 1.45 to see what we 
  should have at this point.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The final thing we need 
  to do is to make it so that we can view it ingame as a world model. But we will 
  first have to check its size and position to be correct for ingame use. Chances 
  are that it will be of monstrous dimensions. The first world model of a Pipe 
  bomb I made was big as a house, and the team laughed so hard when we went into 
  a DM MP game with it in the map that it took weeks of therapy to calm us down! 
  One of the comments about it is shown in Figure 1.46</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before we compare the what 
  size we need, first we have to save our file. For us to compare its size to 
  a human or another weapon is that you should open up a v_weapon.mdl file and 
  make a box to fit around the weapon. Then you should delete all the groups and 
  the joints or bones in it so that just your box remains. (See Figures 1.47 and 
  1.48).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will next delete all 
  the joints by going to the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Joint&quot;</font> rollout 
  and selecting the first bone in the list as shown in figure 1.49, then deleting 
  it by using the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Delete&quot;</font> key on the keyboard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will next switch to 
  the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Groups&quot;</font> rollout and select and delete 
  one by one all the <strong><em>&quot;groups,&quot;</em></strong> except of course 
  the <strong><em>&quot;box&quot;</em></strong> group that you just created. Next 
  go to the &quot;Materials&quot; rollout and delete all the materials, as we 
  do not want any unwanted references to materials that are not used in our knife 
  file. Then you will save this in the directory that you created your knife. 
  You should name it something like <em><strong>&quot;Box-Scale.ms3d,&quot;</strong></em> 
  so as to remind you what this file is.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this point you will open 
  the <em><strong>&quot;knife2(ref).ms3d.&quot;</strong></em> You need to merge 
  the box into this file now. Select <font color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>F</u>ile-&gt;<u>M</u>erge...&quot;</font> 
  on the menu selections, and choose the <em><strong>&quot;Box-Scale.ms3d&quot;</strong></em> 
  file. You may find it hard to find this new item, if you do not first zoom out 
  in all viewports before the merge. You might want to rotate this box so that 
  it will be easier to scale the knife to about the same size. In Figure 1.50 
  you can see that my knife creation was a bit to large, and will need to be scaled 
  down. Refer back to the reference on how to scale and do this now. Here is a 
  tip to help: set the scales of the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;X,&quot; &quot;Y,&quot;</font> 
  and <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Z&quot;</font> axis to .9 in the scale text 
  boxes and keep clicking the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Scale&quot;</font> button 
  in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Scale Options&quot;</font> section until 
  the desired size is achieved.</font></p>
