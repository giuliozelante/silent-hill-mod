        <h1>From A to Z: Complete Model Construction</h1>
        <p>This tutorial is aimed at the total beginner to the intermediate skill 
          level of 3D model construction. It deals with fairly advanced topics 
          but nothing is taken for granted and everything is explained clearly 
          so that mostly everyone can understand.</p>
        <p>In this tutorial I aim to have a completely modeled and animated human 
          female biped model. The steps involved in this creation process are 
          as follows.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create the model in <a href="http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft">MilkShape 
            3D</a>. This involves creating the meshes for the different parts 
            of the body using vertices and polygons and grouping them to create 
            meshes (groups of polygons).</li>
          <li>Unwrap the meshes in <a href="http://www.ultimateunwrap3d.com">Ultimate 
            Unwrap 3D</a>. This invloves mapping a checker material onto the surfaces 
            of the model and adjusting the UV coordinates to achieve the best 
            planar material distribution over the faces. This means adjusting 
            the UV coordinates to avoid texture stretching.</li>
          <li>Texturemap the model using the UV maps exported from Ultimate Unwrap 
            3D as a result of UV unwrapping. These UV maps will be painted using 
            Adobe Photoshop 5.5.</li>
          <li>Animate a walk animation using <a href="http://www.swissquake.ch/chumbalum-soft">MilkShape 
            3D</a>. This involves creating a skeleton and posing it at key-frames 
            in the animation cycle.</li>
        </ol>
