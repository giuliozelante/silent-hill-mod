          <p>The next step in setting a model up for animation is assigning the 
            vertices of the model to the bones (you are actually assigning vertices 
            to joints but the word bones is used). This process is sometimes complicated, 
            the level of complexity depending on how densely populated your model 
            is with vertices and bones.</p>
          <p>The reason you need to assign vertices to bones is so that MilkShape 
            3D (and any other application you may export it to) knows which parts 
            of the model move in relation to the joints they are assigned to. 
            If you don't assign bones then animate your model, only the skeleton 
            will move, the model won't.</p>
          <p>It is best to think about how you will assign vertices to bones when 
            modelling so you know where to place vertices to give the best mesh 
            deformation. The model I made contains logically arranged vertices 
            that originate around where I thought I would be placing the joints.</p>
          <p>It is important to<span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> 
            familiarise</span> yourself with the process of assigning vertices 
            to joints the steps are:</p>
          <ul type=disc>
            <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
       auto;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'><span
       style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Select the desired joint in 
              the Joints tab of the toolbox (its best to do it this way rather 
              than select in a viewport).<o:p></o:p></span></li>
            <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
       auto;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'><span
       style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Use the Select tool with the 
              Vertex modifier to select the vertices you want to assign to the 
              joint.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
            <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
       auto;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'><span
       style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Press the 'Assign' button on 
              the Joints tab of the Toolbox.<o:p></o:p></span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>To confirm the assignation of the vertices to the joint de-select 
            the vertices, click the joint again then click 'SelAssigned'. This 
            will select the vertices assigned to the selected joint. Now to assign 
            the vertices.</p>
          <blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'> 
            <p>1. Make sure you are <b>not</b> in animation mode.<br>
              2. Select the 'cranium' joint from the Joints tab of the Toolbox.<br>
              3. Use the Select tool with the vertex modifier and drag a box over 
              the vertices that make up the head to select the joints shown below.</p>

              (Left-Click Drag).<br>
              4. When you have selected the vertices the joint will turn to the 
              default colour again (blue in this case) indicating that it is not 
              selected but don't worry the name of the joint in the Joints tab 
              of the Toolbox is still highlighted so all you have to do is press 
              'Assign'. Now deselect the vertices (just click in the empty workspace 
              in the viewport) and click 'SelAssigned', the vertices you just 
              assigned will be selected again confirming that the 'Assign' action 
              worked.</p>

          <p>I won't bother going through the whole process of assigning every 
            vertex in the model to a bone but I will highlight some scenarios 
            such as limb movement...</p>
          <p>When I first started modelling I used to assign the vertices that 
            formed the joint in the limb to the bone, I later found out after 
            rotating joints around in animation mode that the way I had assigned 
            vertices was totally wrong. You see, the vertices that are assigned 
            to that joint are the ones that will move when that joint is moved. 
            I left out the vertices in the middle of limbs because they weren't 
            vertices that formed a joint, therefore I thought that they would 
            move because the rest of the vertices moved, if you see what I mean 
            - I was wrong. The image below shows an example of the scenario I'm 
            talking about, the joints that I assigned to start with and the ones 
            I should have assigned...</p>

          <p>You might think that there is no problem with this but when we come 
            to animating the right knee joint watch what happens...</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>The view on the left shows that the unassigned vertices stayed in 
            the same position because they were not assigned to the joint, this 
            creates the abnormality you see circled in red. The view on the right 
            shows the correct way in which the vertices were assigned therefore 
            making the vertices rotate with the joint. Keep this in mind when 
            you are assigning the rest of the vertices to bones throughout the 
            model. </p>
