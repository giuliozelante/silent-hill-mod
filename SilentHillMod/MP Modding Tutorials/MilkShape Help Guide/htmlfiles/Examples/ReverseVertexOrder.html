  <h1>Reverse Vertex Order</h1>
  <p>The Reverse Vertex Order command is a useful one when<span lang=EN-GB
  style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> modelling</span>. It commonly comes into
  play when you have been linking vertices to form faces (triangles) with the
  Face tool on the Model tab in the Toolbox. Vertices must be linked in a
  counter-clockwise direction to form a face (one that faces outward). When
  linking vertices it is easy to link them the wrong way.</p>

  <p>This image shows the front (on the left) and the perspective (on the
  right) views of a square flat surface composed of nine vertices and eight
  triangles. </p>
  <p>Please note that the shading type used in the perspective viewport is Flat
  Shaded, this can be selected by right clicking the viewport and selecting
  Flat Shaded from the pop-up menu (the default is Smooth Shaded. We use the
  Flat Shaded view because it gives a better view of the faces that are causing
  the problem (they are in black). An explanation for the reason behind this
  can be found in the section: <a href="../Appendices/3DTheoryPractice.html">3D
  Theory &amp; Practice</a> in the appendix.</p>
  <p>The triangles in the upper left and lower right quarters were created
  using the Face tool, selecting vertices in a counter-clockwise direction as
  shown in red in the image, therefore these faces face towards the viewer,
  outwards. The triangles in the upper right and lower left quarters were
  created using the Face tool, selecting vertices in a clockwise direction as
  shown in blue in the image, therefore these faces face away from the viewer,
  inwards.</p>
  <p>This was done on purpose to show what happens when different vertex orders
  are used but now if we select the four triangles which are facing inward
  (away from the viewer) then select Face-&gt;Reverse Vertex Order the faces
  will face outward as shown in this image.</p>

  <p>As you can see, the wireframe front view has not changed. This is because
  the command does not change the physical construction of the model, it just
  reverses the order that the triangle is joined to the vertices. In the
  perspective view all the faces now face outward as we wanted. If we had
  selected all eight faces then reversed the vertex order the opposite of the
  model in the first image would have been achieved, i.e. all faces facing
  inward would face outward and all faces facing outward would face inward.</p>
  <p>The menu command Face-&gt;Face to Front would have served the same purpose
  as reversing the vertex order on the four black triangles. With Face to Front
  you can always be sure that your polygons are facing outward rather than
  using Reverse Vertex Order with which you can't ever be<span
  style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> <span lang=EN-GB>absolutely</span></span><span
  lang=EN-GB> </span>certain that your polygons are facing the correct way,
  i.e. outward.</p>
