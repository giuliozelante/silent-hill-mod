                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>16.</SPAN> Ohkee Dohkie... picking up 
                  from the last page... believe me we have a shit load more to 
                  go through, but hopefully after you have made this one weapon 
                  you will have the knowledge you need to experiment and make 
                  more weapons... I dread to think of how many "Look!!1!!11 My 
                  New Glock Weapon" mods there will be floating around after 
                  this tutorial... OW MY HEAD!!! STOP THE VOICES!!! <IMG 
                  class=blank alt=:lol: 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/lol.gif" 
                  align=top></P>
                  <P>Yo! so... the next step here is to bring the length of the 
                  extruded part back so that it will cover the breach hole (when 
                  we make one). So bring the camera around to look at the back 
                  end of the part you just made, you have the view shown in the 
                  screener. <SPAN class=hl>Select "vertex" from the modifier 
                  stack</SPAN> and select all of the vertices (dots) on my 
                  screener...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/pic16.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>17.</SPAN> Now <SPAN class=hl>DRAG 
                  these vertices back</SPAN> and watch the whole extruded part 
                  move with it. Uhm, just a reminder to use the <SPAN 
                  class=hl>MOVE tool along the X-Axis (red arrow)</SPAN>. Use 
                  the TOP view to move this section back... I'd say to just over 
                  half of the length of the gun - or if you like; where the 
                  trigger guard meets the handle. It should now look like 
                  this... </P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/pic17.jpg"></P>

                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>18.</SPAN> So, hey? Remember earlier 
                  when we hid some parts of the gun? Well it's time to unhide 
                  them! First though you need to <SPAN class=hl>save-as "Glock 
                  5"</SPAN>. Go to the <SPAN class=hl>"display panel"</SPAN> 
                  where you hid those items, and<SPAN class=hl> CLICK "Unhide 
                  all"</SPAN>... (now if only I could do that to find my 
                  keys...). Ok so you have all your parts back, now you are 
                  reminded of just how shitty the model looks, but that will 
                  change over the course of this tutorial... I hope... *gulp*. 
                  Ok, so... you should now <SPAN class=hl>SELECT</SPAN> the<SPAN 
                  class=hl> trigger guard object</SPAN>, and in the "<SPAN 
                  class=hl>absolute positioning boxes</SPAN>" (those 3 input 
                  boxes I have mentioned a few times... X, Y, Z...) - in 
                  the<SPAN class=hl><B> Z box TYPE&nbsp; "10.0"</B></SPAN> The 
                  trigger guard should be half-way up and in the middle of the 
                  handle. Like this...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/pic18.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>19.</SPAN> What we're about to do is 
                  UNION or if you like FUSE the trigger guard to the handle but 
                  first... we need to make the backend of the trigger guard 
                  bigger so it transitions nicely into the handle. So turn <SPAN 
                  class=hl>WIREFRAME</SPAN> mode on in your <SPAN class=hl>3D 
                  view</SPAN> and rotate the camera to look at the backend of 
                  the trigger guard so it looks like the screener.</P>
                  <P>Before you can proceed, you might remember from the first 
                  part that we needed to make the BASE object editable? Well we 
                  need to do the <SPAN class=hl>same for the trigger guard 
                  object</SPAN> too! So from the modifiers stack/list, <SPAN 
                  class=hl>RIGHT CLICK on the "extrude" item/modifier</SPAN> (as 
                  before) and from the menu that pops up, <SPAN class=hl>select 
                  "collapse to"...</SPAN> now select the back end of the trigger 
                  guard using <SPAN class=hl>POLYGON selection mode</SPAN> from 
                  the modifiers stack... (Look at my screener it's highlighted 
                  yellow). Select the <SPAN class=hl>SCALE tool</SPAN> and along 
                  the <SPAN class=hl>BLUE arrow (Z axis) drag upwards</SPAN> so 
                  it's slopping but still remains <SPAN class=hl>inside the 
                  bounds of the handle...</SPAN> if you feel like tweaking other 
                  parts of the guard object some more, then use <SPAN 
                  class=hl>EDGE for selection</SPAN> from the modifier stack and 
                  tweak away, just stay symmetrical. Here's what my gun looks 
                  like...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/pic19.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>20.</SPAN> Ok now we are ready to UNION 
                  the 2 shapes. By the way, now is a good time to save...</P>
                  <P>From the <SPAN class=hl>creation tab</SPAN> (1st icon with 
                  the mouse pointer)... <SPAN class=hl>select the "geometry" 
                  button</SPAN> which is the sphere icon, then from the drop 
                  down list below that find and <SPAN class=hl>click "compound 
                  objects"</SPAN>. Now you have some new options for object 
                  creation, <SPAN class=hl>click the "BOOLEAN" button</SPAN>. 
                  Now make sure that <SPAN class=hl>UNION is selected</SPAN> and 
                  then <SPAN class=hl>press "Pick operand B"</SPAN> now <SPAN 
                  class=hl>click the main base of the gun</SPAN>. At this stage, 
                  your weapon will be triangulated where there is a union. This 
                  is fine. And your weapon should look like this...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/pic20.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>21.</SPAN> Ok, so now we work on the 
                  breach! Hiiii hoooo silver! For this part we are going to be 
                  making the ejection hole where the bullet casing flies out, 
                  since I don't have a reference for where this is on the gun 
                  I'm going to be guessing *cough*... We'll start out from where 
                  the extruded part we made earlier ends... this is where the 
                  casings will be ejected...</P>
                  <P>Right so in the <SPAN class=hl>creation tab select 
                  BOX</SPAN>, now drag out a cube to like in my screener, I 
                  didn't have any measurements in mind... you may need to tweak 
                  it up with the <SPAN class=hl>SCALE and MOVE tools</SPAN>... 
                  but as long as you have it looking like in my picture, it'll 
                  look fine... Don't forget the Glock18c (like most guns) is a 
                  right handed gun and the bullets will be ejected from the 
                  <SPAN class=hl>RIGHT HAND SIDE</SPAN>! So naturally because of 
                  this, your hole will need to be carved out from the 
                  underside... </P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/pic21.jpg"></P>

                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>22.</SPAN> Now, the next step will be 
                  to <SPAN class=hl>Boolean SUBTRACT the two objects</SPAN>, so 
                  that the box you just made gets removed from the breach 
                  object. But before this can happen the breach needs to be 
                  collapsed and made into an Editable mesh. D'you remember how 
                  this is done??? ... I just knew you'd say no... uhm, that's 
                  fine... so... from the top; go to the <SPAN class=hl>modifiers 
                  panel</SPAN>, <SPAN class=hl>select the top item</SPAN> in 
                  your list (will have a light bulb next to it)... and it should 
                  be called <SPAN class=hl>"extrude"</SPAN> <IMG class=blank 
                  alt=;) 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/wink.gif" 
                  align=top> then <SPAN class=hl>RIGHT CLICK</SPAN> it and <SPAN 
                  class=hl>select "collapse to"</SPAN> <IMG class=blank alt=:D 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/grin.gif" 
                  align=top></P>
                  <P>Cool if you had no problems there, then... go <SPAN 
                  class=hl>back to the "creation panel"</SPAN>, select <SPAN 
                  class=hl>"compound object"</SPAN>, then <SPAN 
                  class=hl>"Boolean"</SPAN>. Ensure the breach is selected 
                  first, then <SPAN class=hl><U>make sure that you have 
                  "subtract" selection (A-B) selected!!!</U></SPAN>, now <SPAN 
                  class=hl>press "pick operand B"</SPAN> then <SPAN 
                  class=hl>click the new box object</SPAN>, this is what you 
                  get...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG

                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>23.</SPAN> Ok uh... Gosh... from here, 
                  I will just go onto making the trigger and then well, I'll 
                  leave it to you model in the small details. I'm gonna also 
                  finish up my model with some minor detail tweaks and then move 
                  straight onto texturing...</P>
                  <P>Ok that trigger... this is simple as can be... basically 
                  you should <SPAN class=hl>outline the trigger in TOP 
                  view</SPAN> using the same method when you modelled the other 
                  gun parts. </P>
                  <P>Well, now you are asking why didn't I get you to do it back 
                  then? Well, I want you to do it now for practice! So you can 
                  see how much you remember! But, when you come to extrude it, 
                  make the extrude value <SPAN class=hl>20.0</SPAN> (same as the 
                  trigger guard)... then click the MOVE button and enter into 
                  the Z box, <SPAN class=hl>10.0</SPAN>. Come on dude! You know 
                  what I'm asking next... Boolean the trigger and the base unit 
                  objects together using <SPAN class=hl><B>UNION</B></SPAN>... 
                  when you final pull all your hair out and manage to do it on 
                  your own... you get this... (again I say... I HOPE).</P>

                  on the detail modelling, but most of you really should have 
                  some basic 3DsMax Knowledge before attempting this tutorial. I 
                  mean, I know some of you reading this are novices and that's 
                  cool but, the thought of dragging on for another freakin' 3 
                  pages telling you in step by step detail how to produce a 
                  simple box or cube is ... err... yeah... well, you get the 
                  point. Anyhow, by this time you have hopefully tweaked your 
                  weapon and added detail to it... and you'll be ready for 
                  texturing. </P>
                  <P>All I did for detail was carve out the barrel hole from the 
                  breach and body, tweaked the trigger, and the trigger guard, 
                  then extruded the back end of the handle and added vertices 
                  right down the center to make it smoother. I also added a 
                  smooth shader, which does nothing to the geometry, just the 
                  way a texture appears. And of course the Castle (Aiming 
                  sights).</P>
                  <P>My weapon now comes to a nasty 470 polys. Well, it ain't 
                  all that bad... but could probably be reduced further to about 
                  420 polys. Right-o, so let's get texturing, firstly you will 
                  need to HAVE a texture to apply to the gun, for now you should 
                  just use the background image you outlined earlier. Select 
                  both the main part of the gun and the breach, this can by done 
                  by using the select tool, from duh, the toolbar (it looks like 
                  a mouse pointer)... <SPAN class=hl>CLICK the base 
                  object</SPAN>, then <SPAN class=hl>hold CTRL</SPAN> and <SPAN 
                  class=hl>CLICK the breach object</SPAN>. Now <SPAN 
                  class=hl>press "M"</SPAN> on your keyboard and a material 
                  window opens up... this is a handy window that allows you to 
                  texture shit and make it look schvveeet <IMG class=blank

                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/blah.gif" 
                  align=top> The window will look like this...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/pic25.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>25.</SPAN> The first thing you need to 
                  do is <SPAN class=hl>click the "Material Type 
                  Selector"</SPAN>, yeah I know this isn't the proper name for 
                  it, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it's really 
                  called... err.... so anyway just click it and a <SPAN 
                  class=hl>second window pops up</SPAN>... I'm HOPING you have 
                  the Max Payne KF plug-ins setup properly because this is where 
                  it will count... the new window is called <SPAN 
                  class=hl>"Material Browser"</SPAN>... from this window <SPAN 
                  class=hl>find "KF Material"</SPAN>. This is a material 
                  inserted by the plug-in that will allow your model to have the 
                  texture you specify and also probably does other stuff like 
                  convert mapping co-ordinates to Max Payne 2 standards... <SPAN 
                  class=hl>DON'T USE ANYTHING ELSE</SPAN> other than "KF 
                  MATERIAL"!</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/pic25_1.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist><B>26.</B></SPAN> <SPAN class=hl>Double 
                  click</SPAN> this material <SPAN class=hl>or CLICK OK</SPAN>, 
                  now everything seems the same... hmm what has changed? I know! 
                  maybe one of the spheres has changed color? No big deal... 
                  this is normal. Have a look under the "basic parameters" 
                  rollout... and <SPAN class=hl>change the diffuse color to 
                  white</SPAN>, you can do this by <SPAN class=hl>clicking the 
                  diffuse color box and using the color map to point at 
                  WHITE</SPAN>. When you are done with that, scroll down the 
                  material window to the "TEXTURES" rollout, and <SPAN 
                  class=hl>TICK the diffuse checkbox</SPAN> and then <SPAN 
                  class=hl>click the little box next to it that says 
                  "NONE"</SPAN>. Again, the material browser will open... now 
                  <SPAN class=hl>find and select "KF Texture"</SPAN>.</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/pic26.jpg"></P>
                  <P>Once you've done that you'll be back in the material window 
                  again, have a look at the <SPAN class=hl>"basic 
                  parameters"</SPAN>, AND... the first item there is <SPAN 
                  class=hl>BITMAP</SPAN>. <SPAN class=hl>Click that box and then 
                  select your texture</SPAN>... now, the top right hand sphere 
                  has the image of the Glock wrapped around it... right? YUP. 
                  Also at this point <SPAN class=hl>click on the "render texture 
                  to viewport button"</SPAN> - if you don't know which one this 
                  is, it's labelled in the one of the screeners above...</P>
                  <P>Cool... now one more step to go before you can apply this 
                  texture, look on the material window under the 6 spheres, 
                  there should be a <SPAN class=hl>drop down box</SPAN> with an 
                  <SPAN class=hl>eyedropper/pipette</SPAN> next to it... click 
                  the drop down box and <SPAN class=hl>select "1 - 
                  default"</SPAN>. Now <SPAN class=hl>click on the "Paint 
                  material on object" button</SPAN>.</P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>27.</SPAN> Ok, so I mentioned about 
                  setting up a map for your gun, we'll do this now. Again with 
                  both parts of your gun selected, go to the <SPAN 
                  class=hl>"modifiers" panel</SPAN> and from the<SPAN 
                  class=hl>"modifiers list"</SPAN> find, and <SPAN 
                  class=hl>select "UVW Map"</SPAN>... now as soon as it's 
                  selected your gun should show the Glock texture on it 
                  properlly... At this stage, it should look something like what 
                  I intended... but the texture ISN'T quite right...</P>
                  <P>The scaling is slightly squashed from handle to breach... 
                  so <SPAN class=hl>from the modifiers panel</SPAN> have a look 
                  for the <SPAN class=hl>"UVW Map" item you just added</SPAN>, 
                  and under that should be a new item called "Gizmo"... if you 
                  can't see it, click on the little PLUS box. Make sure you have 
                  BOTH parts of your gun selected, now <SPAN class=hl>click the 
                  Gizmo item</SPAN>... and a yellow square appears around your 
                  model... what you now can do is use the normal SCALE and MOVE 
                  tools from the main toolbar to fit the texture as you like it. 
                  I suggest maximizing the TOP viewport and turning the view 
                  mode to <I>"smooth + highlights"</I> so you can work more 
                  accurately... (these options can be accessed in a handy menu 
                  by RIGHT CLICKING the TOP LEFT of the active viewport)...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/pic27.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>28.</SPAN> Right, so my gun has been 
                  textured properly (well to the best I can explain in this 
                  tutorial), and if you go back to all 4 viewport windows, 
                  select the 3D view; and then <SPAN class=hl>press F10</SPAN>, 
                  then press the <SPAN class=hl>RENDER button</SPAN>... you can 
                  see what your model looks like...</P>
                  <P align=center><IMG 
                  src="Kipsta's PayneKiller  Max Payne 2 Mod Resource Site_file/glock1.jpg"></P>
                  <DIV class=hr>
                  <HR>
                  </DIV>
                  <P><SPAN class=numlist>29.</SPAN> Ok, so finally, you will 
                  notice that the weapon isn't textured as good as it could be 
                  (check out the video I put below)... you can improve the 
                  quality of the texturing by creating a fitted weapon texture 
                  map, and using UVW Unwrap. I'm not gonna explain this since 
                  the idea was to just show you how to get started with weapon 
                  modelling... </P>
                  <P>One final thing to note is that most of the detail on the 
                  weapon we made is minor, we have modelled the main geometry of 
                  the gun and left the detail to the textures.</P>
                  <P>Well, that's the end of this freakin' long ass tutorial... 
                  I really really freakin' hope you have learned a little 
                  something about weapon modelling, as I said before it's down 
                  to your own imagination and creative genius to produce 
                  feasible low poly weapons that look good. There are no 
                  map/model downloads for this tutorial, since I know a lot of 
                  people will just rip the weapon off for their own mod... there 
                  is however a video rendering of the finished weapon (with some 
                  added gloss to make it spangly and sexy...)...</P>
                  <P>As for Implementing it, adding sound and animations... they 
                  come in later tutorials...</P>
