      ParticleFX Tutorial</h1>
        <h2>What is ParticleFX</h2>
      <blockquote>
      <p>ParticleFX
is a powerful particle effect editing tool that was used to create all
the fire, smoke, explosions, muzzle flashes and snowstorms you saw in
Max Payne. The idea of the tool was to give the graphic artists a
separate environment for particle effect creation and previewing,
allowing to effectively focus on the effects themselves.<br>
      <br>
The purpose of this documentation is to introduce you to the basics of
ParticleFX, give you a step-by-step tutorial in creating a particle
effect, and familiarize you with all the parameters available.</p>
      <p><span lang="EN-US">This should cover most of the
      issues and features of ParticleFX. We sincerely hope you find this tutorial helpful and informative.</span></p>
      <p>Please note, that these Tutorials&nbsp; are
      work-in-progress. Remedy will make frequent updates: plenty of new items
      will be added and old ones fixed in the following weeks.</p>
      <p>Yours,<br>
      Max Payne <span lang="EN-US"> development </span>team</p>
