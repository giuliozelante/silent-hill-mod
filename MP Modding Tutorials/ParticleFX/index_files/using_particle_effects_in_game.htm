      <h1>Using the particle effects in the game</h1>
      <blockquote>
      <p class="MsoNormal">To use a particle effect in the
      game, it needs to be exported. Open a particle effect and select
      Export from the File menu. The effect is exported into a .RPS (Realtime
      Particle Set) which is a stand-alone file, containing the bitmaps and the
      needed parameters.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;If you have created a large
      set of particle effects and bitmaps and then modify one bitmap set, it can
      get difficult to re-export them all. To help with this, you can export
      particle effects with a command line. You can create a batch file, which
      exports all the particles to their respective folders. Here is an example
      export command line (NOTE: this is only an example; the paths and
      directories need to correspond your setup).</p>
        <dl>
          <dd>
      <p class="fixed">ParticleFX.exe -y -e "\particle effects\fire\*.pse"
      -d "\database\particles\fire\"</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      <p>After the effects have been
      exported, they need to be plugged into the game&#8217;s database thru the
      particle script file. This file (particles.txt) can be found in the
      game&#8217;s data\database\particles\ directory.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Once in the game, the effects are
      started with the <b>ps_starteffect </b> message. For further info, consult
      the level editor documentation.</p>
