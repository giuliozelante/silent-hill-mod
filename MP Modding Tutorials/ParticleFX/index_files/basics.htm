      The Basics</h1>
      <blockquote>
      <p>If this is the first time you&#8217;re using the
      particle editor, it&#8217;s advised to read this section first.</p>
        <p><i>"OK,
      I&#8217;ve started the editor and set my display driver settings. Now
      what?"</i></p>
      <p>Before you can do anything, you need to either open
      and modify an existing particle effect, or create a new one by pressing
      New. For now, try opening one of the example .PSE files and read on.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Editing an effect</h2>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Particle effects consist of two basic elements: <b>Particles</b> and <b>Emitters</b>.
      Particles are the things you see flying on the screen, and Emitters are
      the gizmos that spew them out.</p>
      <p>However, before a particle and an emitter become a working effect, an <b>Emission</b>
      must be created, which determines which particles are spawned by which
      emitters. You can see how these are arranged in the example particle files
      provided with the editor.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Previewing
      the effect</h2>
      <blockquote>
      <p>When editing an effect, you can
      preview it by pressing <b>F2</b>, or by clicking the &#8220;Run Preview&#8221;
      button in the top toolbar. When in preview mode, you can do the following:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Press <b>F2</b>  again to restart the effect</li>
          <li>Press <b>F3</b> to pause / continue the effect (you can still rotate the
          view)</li>
          <li>Use <b>
          the arrow keys</b> to rotate the view around the effect. Use <b>Page
          Up</b> and <b>Page Down</b> to zoom in and out.</li>
          <li>Hold
          down <b>Ctrl</b> when rotating and zooming to speed up the movement</li>
          <li>Hold
          down <b>Shift</b> when rotating and zooming for slow, precise movement</li>
        </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;In preview mode, there are
      some informative numbers in the upper right corner of the screen.&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>FPS: </b>
          The framerate counter. With this, you can measure how much CPU your
          particle effect is using.</li>
          <li><b>Particles:</b>
          The number of particles currently active in the effect. If this number
          turns red, it means that the set maximum set limit has been reached
          and exceeded.</li>
          <li><b>Max: </b>The peak number of particles that have been active in the
          effect. If this number turns red, it means that the maximum set limit
          has been reached.</li>
          <li><b>Radius:</b>
          The radius of the whole particle effect in meters. The radius is
          determined by the particle furthest away from the emitter origo. It is
          advisable to avoid the effect from growing too large due to loose
          particles traveling too far away from the center.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>When you&#8217;re finished viewing the effect, press <b>F4</b>
      to close the preview. Note that any changes you make to the effect, while
      the preview window is open, won&#8217;t be applied before you&#8217;ve
      closed the view and opened it again.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Editing graphs</h2>
      <blockquote>
      <p>As you may have noticed at this point, some buttons pop up a window
      containing an editable graph when clicked. This is how many of the
      particle effect&#8217;s properties are defined. Unlike constant values,
      graphs smoothly change the value of the parameter through time. Graphs can
      be easily edited by moving, adding and deleting nodes, the points
      that are connected by the line.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="center"><img src="basics_files/example_graph.gif" border="0" height="200" width="320"><br>
      <i>A Single graph</i></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Actually the graphs themselves don&#8217;t determine the final values
      in the particle effect. The graph is in fact <i>sampled by</i> the
      particle engine and converted to a set of delta-reduced values. The thin
      line trailing along the graph represents the sampled result. To change the
      <i>sample rate</i> of the graph, press / and * on the keypad. The sample
      rate (sr) is displayed in the upper right corner of the graph window.
      Adjust the value and see how it affects the thin line. To optimize the
      particle effect it is a good idea to use an as low sample rate as
      possible. If you use the graph for a constant or a linear ramp value, a
      sample rate of 2 is enough. If, on the other hand, you want to use a very
      complex graph with small rapid changes, you may need to increase its
      sample rate.</p>
      <p>Some Emitter graph parameters contain two graphs instead of one.
      This means that the actual values are <i>randomized</i> between the two
      graphs whenever a particle is emitted. The further the two graphs are from
      each other, the more diversity the resulting values have. If the graphs
      overlap completely, there is no randomization.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="basics_files/example_2graph.gif" border="0" height="200" width="320"><br>
      <i>A Double graph. The final value is picked at random between the two
      graphs.</i></p>
      <p>Finally, the particle coloring and the emitter lights have a Color
      Graph. There are three graphs, one for each color element: Red, Green and
      Blue.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="basics_files/example_colorgraph.gif" border="0" height="201" width="320"><br>
      <i>An RGB color graph.</i></p>
      <p>The graph window can be scaled freely like any window by clicking and
      dragging its corners. When you close the graph window, its contents are
      automatically saved.</p>
      <p>Graphs can be copied to and pasted from the clipboard between files.
      Please note that this only works between respective graphs. You
      cannot copy a Size Graph to a Color Graph.</p>
        <p>You can edit the graphs by doing the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To <i>zoom</i> the graph display vertically in and out, press <b>+</b>
          and <b>-</b> on the keypad, or click the <b> Zoom In</b> and <b> Zoom Out</b> buttons
          on the toolbar.</li>
          <li>To
          adjust the resolution of the background grid, press <b>Ctrl-G</b> or
          click the <b>Grid Resolution</b> button on the toolbar. The grid is
          just a visual aid.</li>
          <li>To <i>
          insert</i> a new node to the graph, double click on the graph with <b>
          the left mouse button</b> at the point where you want the node
          inserted. To <i> remove</i> a node, select the node by clicking on it
          with the left mouse button, and press <b>Del</b>.</li>
          <li>To <i>
          move</i> a node, click and drag it with the <b>left mouse button</b>. If
          you press and hold <b>Shift</b> while dragging nodes, all the nodes in
          the respective position of the other graphs will also move (only
          applicable if the value has multiple graphs). If you hold down <b>Ctrl</b>
          while dragging nodes, the node&#8217;s movement is restricted to
          vertical axis.</li>
          <li>If
          you click and drag a node with the <b>right mouse button</b>, the
          entire graph will shift up and down.</li>
          <li>To
          enter a numerical value for a node or set of nodes, select the
          node by clicking on it with <b> the left mouse button</b>, then press <b>N</b>.
          If the graph is a Color Graph, you can edit the color values with a
          Windows color picker by pressing <b>C</b>.</li>
          <li>To scale the entire graph vertically, hold down <b>Ctrl</b> and
          drag a node with the right mouse button.</li>
        </ul>
