<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In order for us not to be 
  able to accidentally chose a wrong vertex in our face creation, we will hide 
  these selected vertices by clicking on <font color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>E</u>dit-&gt;<u>H</u>ide 
  Selection&quot;</font> on the menu selections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Its time we sew up this 
  back side of the knife blade by selecting the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Face&quot;</font> tool once again. We will be working in 
  the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Back&quot;</font> viewport for this operation. Remember 
  to use a counter-clockwise motion to make the faces to be appearing to face 
  us and not turned inside out, so it would appear as if they are missing if we 
  were to view it on the backside. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The vertices at the bottom 
  may be a little tricky to complete as there are 4 of them close enough together 
  that might cause some problems. You might avoid some of this by zooming in closer 
  to see them. This is done by clicking on the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Selection&quot;</font> 
  button to turn off the selection tool and first holding down the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Ctrl&quot;</font> 
  key on your keyboard and dragging in the<font color="#0000FF"> &quot;Back&quot;</font> 
  viewport to center the area to zoom in on. Then you will hold down the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Shift&quot;</font> key and drag in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Back&quot;</font> 
  viewport to zoom in. As you can see this is good for fine tuning those hard 
  to get at vertices!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now we will finish the back 
  portion by clicking on the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Face&quot;</font> button 
  to turn on the tool, then carefully creating the two final faces that sew the 
  bottom of the blade to the left and right sides. (See the faces at the bottom 
  of Figure 1.27).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Texture mapping is going 
  to be usually way off as new faces are added to the existing groups. The new 
  faces will add themselves to an existing group, usually to the groups vertex 
  that you first click on. We will have to select all of the faces we wish to 
  put into a new group which we will name <em><strong>&quot;Blade-back&quot;</strong></em> 
  group. (See Figure 1.27). Switch to the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Select&quot;</font> 
  tool and turn on the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Faces&quot;</font> option. 
  We will also be using the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Ignore Backfaces&quot;</font> 
  option by clicking in the check box. It should have a check mark to indicate 
  that it will not select backfaces to make our selection of these faces easier. 
  Move to the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Front&quot;</font> viewport so that 
  we can select the faces that we just have created. Now this is a bit odd that 
  we should have to move to the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Front&quot;</font> 
  viewport, when the faces we want to select are on the back with their faces 
  towards us. Don't ask, I don't know why it was programmed this way.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Switch to the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Groups&quot;</font> 
  rollout and click the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Regroup&quot;</font> button. Rename this group to <em><strong>&quot;Blade-back&quot;</strong></em> 
  group.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This group will have to 
  have its texture aligned to it. The <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Back&quot;</font> 
  viewport is where we will be working to align the texture. If your <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Texture 
  Coordinate Editor&quot;</font> dialog box is still hanging around, perhaps you 
  have minimized it, get it to show up so you can work with it. There is a drop 
  down list box that contains all the names of the groups in it, click on the 
  down arrow and select the <em><strong>&quot;Blade-back&quot;</strong></em> group. 
  Chose the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Back&quot;</font> from the viewport drop 
  down list, as we want it to apply the texture in the back 2d dimension. If you 
  select the wrong 2d view of applying a texture, it may stretch the texture in 
  a manner that will look deformed or like someone took a spray paint can and 
  just streaked the paint on the sides. We want or model to appear as if looks 
  real from all sides. This is the toughest part of what is called <strong>&quot;Skinning&quot;</strong> 
  a model.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Click the &quot;Region&quot; 
  button, and click and drag your mouse over the back area of the blade where 
  it is dark. (See Figure 1.28).</font></p>
