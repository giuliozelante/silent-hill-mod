<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now you will rename the 
  material to something that will fit what we are trying to model.Double click 
  in the text box area that presently says <em><strong>&quot;Material01&quot;</strong></em> 
  and type in what will make more sense: <em><strong>&quot;Knife2.bmp</strong></em>&quot;. 
  (See figure 1.20). This will be the material that we will be getting next.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will have to find where 
  our bmp of the knife2 is. You should put them in the directory where the model 
  is being built or in a subdirectory of the models directory that you have chosen 
  to use. Another thing you will have to keep in mind if you are going to make 
  the skin yourself, is that HL models have to be a 256, 8 bit indexed color bmp 
  format, and it has to be a power of 16. So the smallest bmp you can have would 
  be a 16x16 bmp file. The largest file would be a 256x256 bmp for the reasons 
  that most video cards work in powers of 2 up to 256x256 memory blocks. This 
  was inherited by the Quake engine that Half Life licensed and highly modified 
  for the game play.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To get the material, I have 
  put it in the same directory as the Ms3d file that I am working with. Oh! did 
  I save it as often as you can because of freaking things that happen when your 
  working on a computer, such as Fido coming along and chomping on your power 
  cord to the computer and dying, then you have to take time to bury him and then 
  you lost the blankity blank file! Make backups as well, especially when you 
  are getting ready to make a major change to your work, so you will have something 
  to go back to, in case of a mess!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nuff said about that. click 
  the first <font color="#0000FF">&quot;None&quot;</font> button in the Material 
  section of the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Material&quot;</font> rollout. (See 
  figure 1.21).</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="ms3d_hl-1/mt-fig21.gif" width="622" height="339"

  1.21 Importing the&nbsp;material</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Select the knife2.bmp file 
  and it will put it into the knife2.bmp material. If you want to have some fun, 
  click and hold the mouse button on the Material sphere and drag it around to 
  see it as it would be applied to a sphere!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are now going to apply 
  this material to the knife blade that we have just made, or rather one side 
  of it. You will have to switch back to the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Model&quot;</font> 
  rollout, and click on the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Select&quot;</font> button 
  and click on the &quot;Face&quot; button in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Select 
  Options&quot;</font> portion of the rollout. Drag your mouse across all the 
  faces to select them all, or you can use the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>E</u>dit-&gt;Select 
  A<u>l</u>l&quot;</font> on the menu selections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now we need to make a group 
  of the selected faces so that it will be easier to select when we start to make 
  other portions of the knife. We do this so we can hide portions of a model so 
  that we can best work with a area of a model such as in the case of <strong>&quot;Skinning&quot;</strong> 
  a model or texture mapping the faces in a group. Click on the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Groups&quot;</font> 
  tab of the rollouts and click the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Regroup&quot;</font> 
  Button to create or regroup all the selected faces. (See figure 1.22). You will 
  notice in Figure 1.22 that we have the &quot;Auto Smooth&quot; option checked, 
  as it should be. Smoothing a Group will make the rough edges of the poly &quot;faces&quot; 
  appear to blend instead of being razor sharp. Something a character model does 
  not need or most weapons, e.g. a gun barrel or a persons face. You will be renaming 
  this new group to <em><strong>&quot;Blade-Left&quot;</strong></em> the same 
  way that you renamed the material in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Material&quot;</font> 
  rollout section.</font></p>
