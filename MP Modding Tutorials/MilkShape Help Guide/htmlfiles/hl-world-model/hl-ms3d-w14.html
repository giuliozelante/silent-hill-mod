<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you have 
  made it this far, your are doing great! The final thing to get this model into 
  a Half-Life, will be to create a QC file. Milkshape 3D has made the job easier 
  for us. Select <font color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>T</u>ools-&gt;<u>H</u>alf-Life-&gt;<u>G</u>enerate 
  QC file...&quot;</font> and type in the <em><strong>&quot;File <u>n</u>ame:&quot;</strong></em> 
  text box <em><strong>&quot;w_knife2&quot;</strong></em> for a file name. What 
  will result in this will not be perfect, so we will have to open it for editing. 
  Select&nbsp; <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>T</u>ools-&gt;<u>H</u>alf-Life-&gt;<u>E</u>dit QC file...&quot;</font> 
  and select the <em><strong>&quot;w_knife2.qc&quot;</strong></em> file. You will 
  see the text as shown in Figure 1.56 in <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Notepad&quot;</font> 
  window. You should alter it to like like the text in Figure 1.57.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the 
  differences may not be obvious. One of the most important things to change is 
  the $scale command to read: <em><strong>&quot;$scale 1.3&quot;</strong></em> 
  as world models should appear larger as they will not be held close to the screen 
  like the perspective view of the first persons models. You probably also want 
  to correct the models name. You can call it whatever you like, but it is best 
  to keep the naming convention the same as the rest of the Half-Life models. 
  That is to say put a <em><strong>&quot;w_&quot;</strong></em> in front of the 
  model name. It makes it easier for the coders to figure out what is going on, 
  especially since usually you need 3 models to represent one weapon. You will 
  need a<em><strong> &quot;v_&quot;</strong></em> and a <em><strong>&quot;p_&quot;</strong></em> 
  and a <em><strong>&quot;w_&quot;</strong></em> model for each weapon that you 
  design. Some thought should go into this. A lot of times modelers will strip 
  down a <em><strong>&quot;v_&quot; </strong></em>model to make it into a <em><strong>&quot;w_&quot;</strong></em> 
  model as you will not usually be looking at this model as closely as the <em><strong>&quot;v_&quot; 
  </strong></em>model. The <em><strong>&quot;v_&quot;</strong></em> suffix implies 
  that it will be a <em><strong>&quot;view&quot;</strong></em> model or seen up 
  close in you hands as a player. The <em><strong>&quot;p_&quot;</strong></em> 
  models are usually stripped down versions of the <em><strong>&quot;v_&quot;</strong></em> 
  model as well as these are seen in the 3rd person models or what you see another 
  player hanging onto in battle.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Well lets rap 
  up this model and get it compiled! Select <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>T</u>ools-&gt;<u>H</u>alf-Life-&gt;<u>C</u>ompile QC 
  file...&quot;</font> to start the magic show! If all goes well, (you didn't 
  have doubts did you?), you will have you world model called <em><strong>&quot;w_knife2.mdl&quot;</strong></em> 
  in your directory. To view it you should use <em><strong>&quot;Half-Life Model 
  Viewer&quot;</strong></em> to look at your handy work.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hopefully this 
  tutorial has been helpful to you in the creation of world model and I will get 
  enough response to continue the series of tutorials. If all goes well we will 
  be taking the model that we just made into a <em><strong>&quot;p_&quot;</strong></em> 
  model next, then move on to a <em><strong>&quot;v_&quot;</strong></em> model, 
  which will require animation. Then I hope to help you make a character model.</font></p>
