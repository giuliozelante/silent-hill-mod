<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Again you will have to switch 
  back to the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Groups&quot;</font> rollout to see if 
  this did indeed assign the material, due to many unexplainable reasons, sometimes 
  the first click doesn't do it. Don't ask me the reasons for this, it just happens 
  that way sometimes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this time we will have 
  to do some bit twiddling of the texture coordinates so that the material that 
  we have chosen to assign to this side of the blade is going to align to the 
  faces of our left side of the knife blade.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To do this click on <font color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>W</u>indow-&gt;<u>T</u>exture 
  Coordinate Editor&quot;</font> on the menu selections. Here you will have to 
  chose the group that is presently selected. Next you will click the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Region&quot;</font> 
  button on the dialog box and click and drag a box around only the blade portion 
  as shown in Figure 1.24. Also you will now turn on your <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Textured&quot;</font> 
  option in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;3D&quot;</font> viewport by right 
  clicking in it and clicking on the menu option <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Textured&quot;</font> 
  also shown in Figure 1.24.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now it is starting to look 
  like a knife! We will now make a duplicate of this and mirror this duplicate. 
  To do this you must still have all the faces of the <em><strong>&quot;Blade-Left&quot;</strong></em> 
  group selected. If you do not you can switch to the &quot;Groups&quot; rollout 
  and highlight the <em><strong>&quot;Blade-Left&quot;</strong></em> group and 
  click the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Select&quot;</font> button. You will need to switch to the 
  <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Model&quot;</font> rollout. Here we will chose the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>E</u>dit-&gt;<u>D</u>uplicate Selection&quot;</font> 
  on the menu selections to make a copy of the group. After this is done we will 
  chose the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>V</u>ertex-&gt;Mirror <u>L</u>eft&lt;-&gt;Right&quot;</font> 
  on the menu selections. it should perfectly align with the <em><strong>&quot;Blade-Left&quot;</strong></em> 
  group. You should rename this new group by switching to the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Groups&quot;</font> 
  rollout and renaming it to <em><strong>&quot;Blade-Right&quot;</strong></em> 
  to avoid future confusion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now this duplicate does 
  not have a material assigned to it. First to see a bit of texture magic, spin 
  the view of the knife blades around in the &quot;3D&quot; viewport, by click 
  and holding you mouse button down and dragging it to the left or to the right 
  in the view port window. Spin it until you can see the backside that has no 
  material. Now click on the <font color="#0000FF">Material&quot;</font> rollout 
  and click the assign button. Now you duplicate will assume the texture material 
  and place it perfectly as you have on the <em><strong>&quot;Blade-Left&quot;</strong></em> 
  group. Now takes some bows for your magic act!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next thing we need to 
  do is weld the halves together, that's right! Get out your blow torch and lets 
  weld this puppy! You do this by selecting the vertices that appear in this case 
  to be already joined on the knifes cutting edge. Look at figure 1.25 to see 
  all off the ones that are selected that need to be welded. We will have to do 
  this one by one to insure that they will be done right.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Figure 
  1.25 The 4 vertices to be welded</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now switch to the &quot;Model&quot; 
  rollout if you haven't already done so and select one of the four to be welded 
  with the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Select&quot;</font> tool set to the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Vertex&quot;</font> 
  mode. Next, click on the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>V</u>ertex-&gt;Snap <u>T</u>ogether&quot;</font> menu 
  selection. Now comes the welding part we were discussing. Fire up that Acetylene 
  Torch and, lets do this! Click on the <font color="#0000FF"><u>V</u>ertex-&gt;<u>W</u>eld 
  <u>T</u>ogether&quot;</font> menu selection. If you watch in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;3D&quot;</font> 
  viewport, you may see it go into action, depending on how your looking at it. 
  You might see the faces look like they are fitting together better and change 
  their looks a bit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At this point we will have 
  to fill the gaps on the back side of the blade. We will first be selecting all 
  the vertices that might get in the way of our creating faces as mentioned earlier 
  about the dented box syndrome. Deselect any vertices that may still be selected 
  from the previous operation, by clicking in a blank area in the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;Left&quot;</font> viewport. Next, you will be selecting 
  all of the vertices except the ones on the left outer most edges in the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;Left&quot;</font> 
  viewport as Figure 1.26 shows.</font></p>
