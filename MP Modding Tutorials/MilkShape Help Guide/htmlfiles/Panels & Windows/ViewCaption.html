  <h1>The Viewport Caption Panel</h1>
  <p>The viewport caption is a useful feature, it allows you to see which perspective
  you are viewing the model from</p>

  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>View Perspective<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>The view perspective shows which direction you are viewing the model from,
  this can be Front, Back, Top, Bottom, Left, Right or 3D.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Grid Size/Field of View<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
          <p>This value can be used to change the Field of View. Lower numbers restrict 
            the field of view more but can be used for zooming into objects. A 
            larger number will create a rounded<span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> 
            <span lang=EN-GB>lens</span></span> effect or fish eye effect. Its 
            not common to change this value as the default value of 65 gives an<span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> 
            <span lang=EN-GB>equivalent</span></span> of the way we see things 
            in the real world.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Near<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>Both the near and far values deal with the 3 dimensional clipping volume.
  The Near value is the distance from the viewpoint that the scene will begin
  to be drawn at. To see the effect this has zoom in close to your model and
  incrementally adjust this value you will see that the parts of the model
  closest to the viewpoint will<span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> <span
  lang=EN-GB>disappear</span></span> or &quot;clip&quot;. You will be able to
  see 'inside' the model where parts have been 'clipped'. If you have
  programmed any 3D graphics and have had to deal with a camera set up you will
  be familiar with both the Near and Far values.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Far<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>Whereas near deals with the Z clipping plane closest to the viewpoint this
  deals with the clipping plane at the farthest point the viewpoint can see to.
  Therefore decreasing this value and increasing the Near value will create a
  narrow band of vision. In 3D games popup can occur (especially in driving
  games) where the Far value has been perhaps too small.</p>
