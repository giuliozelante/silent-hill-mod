  <h1>The Texture Coordinate Editor</h1>
  <p>The texture coordinate editor is an essential tool in the texturing of
  your models. With the texture coordinate editor you can assign areas of your
  model (groups) to have a certain texture map.</p>

  <p>This image shows the front torso section of Pedro the Ringmaster and the
  texture bitmap used for texturing Pedro. Notice that the different parts of
  the texture are are split up, it is suggested, in order to cut down on clutter,
  that you use one texture file and not several (i.e. not one for each group of
  your model).</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Window Navigation<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>When the window is first opened the texture is at the original scale and
  the texture appears in the top left of the window. It is useful to have the
  texture in the middle of the window so that its easier to work with. This can
  be achieved in the same way as in the standard MilkShape 3D viewports, <span
  style='color:#FF0033'>Ctrl+Left-Click</span> then dragging the view with the
  mouse.</p>
  <p>The view cannot be zoomed in and out as it can with the normal MilkShape
  3D viewports (<span style='color:#FF0033'>Shift+Left-Click</span> then using
  the mouse movement to zoom). Instead, a number representation has to be
  entered into the Scale box to zoom in and out, see the <a href="#ZoomItem">Scale
  Box &amp; Button</a>.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Select<a name=SelectItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>The select tool is used to select vertices only. Single vertices can be
  selected by <span style='color:#FF0033'>Left-Clicking</span> on them,
  multiple vertices can be selected by <span style='color:#FF0033'>Left-Click-Dragging</span>
  a selection box around them and vertices can be deselected by <span
  style='color:#FF0033'>Right-Clicking</span> on them.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Move<a name=MoveItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>Once vertices are selected they can be moved by pressing the Move button
  then <span style='color:#FF0033'>Left-Click-Dragging</span> the vertices into
  position. This allows the texture to appear in the area that the vertices
  define. Note that this does not change anything in the model it is merely
  used to position the texture on the vertices, this is called UV Mapping, the
  U standing for the X coordinate and V representing the Y coordinate.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Rotate<a name=RotateItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>This operation can only be performed on more than one vertex, performing
  this action on one vertex can give weird results. Generally, though, this is
  used to rotate a group into position, it can be used to rotate a face (by
  selecting its three corresponding vertices) on a part of the texture.
  Rotating the vertices is commonly unused because it results in a knock-on
  warped effect with the surrounding area which may be undesirable.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Scale<a name=ScaleItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>Scaling is carried out in the same way as for the modeling tools, however
  the origin from which scaling is performed is always defined by the user's
  first click when scaling, in exactly the same way as the Scale tool's User
  Point option operates.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Region<a name=RegionItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
          <p>This function allows you to define an area on the texture map (or 
            even outside it) where the selected group (shown in the <a href="#GroupSelectItem">Group 
            Selector</a>) will map to when the Remap button is pressed. For example 
            in the image above the wireframe is the torso section, I clicked the 
            Region button then dragged a box around the top left quarter of the 
            texture map then with the Torso group and the Front view (because 
            the torso is mapped from the front as it is facing the front) selected 
            I clicked Remap, the torso automatically mapped itself to the top 
            left of the texture map. If you have the <a href="#RedrawItem">Redraw</a> 
            checkbox checked you will see the effects of such an operation immediately, 
            without closing the Texture Coordinate Editor.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Group Selector<a name=GroupSelectItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>This combo box allows the user to select which group they want to edit
  texture coordinates for. Only the groups defined in the model will appear in
  this box. When a group is selected its current position on the texture is
  shown, if none has been defined then the user must select the group then
  click the remap button, this will scale and position the group to be centered
  on the texture it can then be manipulated as usual.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>View Selector<a name=ViewSelectItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>This allows the vertices to be positioned on the texture from different
  perspectives. It is compulsory to stick to the one view when positioning the
  vertices on the texture as setting the vertex positions in another view will
  overwrite the vertex positions of the other view. For example in the screen
  shot the front of Pedro's torso is being texture mapped, as this group faces
  to the front of Pedro, I have used the Front view. For his back I used the
  Back view.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Remap Button<a name=RemapItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>This button is used to reset the coordinates of a group. The group will be
  scaled and moved to be centered on the texture.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Clamp Checkbox<a name=ClampItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>This option keeps all vertices within the<span style='mso-ansi-language:
  EN-GB'> <span lang=EN-GB>boundaries</span></span> of the texture map. When
  the vertices are moved they will not go over the boundary of the texture map.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Redraw Checkbox<a name=RedrawItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>This option allows the 3D perspective window to be updated to immediately
  reflect the changes made in the Texture Coordinate Editor window. This is a
  useful option as it means that the Editor does not have to be closed before
  changes are seen on the model.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Scale Box &amp; Button<a name=ZoomItem></a><o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>This is used to zoom the view in and out to allow a better view when
  positioning vertices on the texture map. The default value is 1.0, this is
  the original scale value, the value at which the texture appears actual size.
  To scale the texture up (zoom in) type a higher value into the scale box and
  click the scale button. To zoom out enter a smaller number, but remember not
  to use zero as anything multiplied by zero is zero, meaning you will see
  nothing (except a dot).</p>
