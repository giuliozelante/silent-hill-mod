        <h2><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This is intended as a streamline guide to get you started in MilkShape 
          3D. It should hopefully help you understand some of the concepts that 
          are used when modelling.</p>
        <p>For this tutorial we will build a simple model of a plane using various 
          techniques. When modelling, it is common to stick to one feature such 
          as extrude and shape the faces using scale and move as the model progresses. 
          We are going to tackle the task by using a combination of face creation 
          using placed vertices and extruding faces.</p>
        <p>This tutorial is very much 'on rails' but if you feel that at any point 
          you are getting bored or just don't like the way I'm doing things feel 
          free to break off and try it you own way. After all, self-tought skills 
          are often the hardest to forget, just reading instructions doesn't give 
          the same learning. Trial and error is how I learned to model.</p>
        <h2><a name="Mid-Section"></a>Mid-Section</h2>
        <p>To start off with we will create one half of the model, this is becuase 
          the model will be symetrical. The only way to guarantee symetry is to 
          work with one half, duplicate it then mirror it. When working in this 
          way you also have to remember to weld the vertices in the middle of 
          the model to the adjoining vertices of the other half so that the completed 
          model is shaded properly throughout its vertical equator. For the sake 
          of perfection we wouldn't like to leave it in two halfs anyway.</p>
        <p>1. To start off with, create a box. Do this by clicking box on the 
          Model tab of the Toolbox on the right. </p>
        <p>2. Create the box in the Front perspective in the top left viewport, 
          this is really just a matter of preference. </p>
        <p>3. Drag the box from the top left grid line...</p>
        <p>4. to the bottom right grid line to create a box whos extremes lie 
          on a grid line, this again is another preference rather than a must 
          but it ensures the steps mentioned later will give the desired effect.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>5. The box will turn red to indicate that it is selected. Select the 
          scale tool from the Model tab, the same panel you selected the Box tool 
          from. In the Scale Options panel that appears below the main part of 
          the Model panel enter 0.2 in the box above the Y axis button. This panel 
          is explained more in the <a href="../ToolboxModel.html">Toolbox: Model</a> 
          section. Then press the Scale button.</p>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p>This box will form the main part of the fuselage of the plane we are 
          creating.</p>
        <p>6. I usually prefer working with the left hand side (viewed from behind) 
          of the model when creating symetrical models so we will delete the faces 
          that are facing to the right (when viewing the model from the back). 
          Click the Select button in the model panel then click the Face button 
          in the panel that pops up below this. Make sure the 'Ignore Backfaces' 
          checkbox is checked.</p>
        <p>7. Goto the viewport that has Left side view in the <a href="../Panels%20&amp;%20Windows/ViewCaption.html">Viewport 
          Caption</a>. If none do then just click the drop down perspective list 
          and select the Left view. If the viewport caption is not visible then 
          click the menu item Window-&gt;Show Viewport Caption.</p>
        <p>8. Select the two faces (triangles) that make up the side of the box. 
          Do this by holding in shift and clicking approximetely in the centre 
          of both faces, their wireframe outline will appear red to indicate they 
          are selected. Press delete, this will remove the faces.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><img src="../Images/BeginnersTuto/Image3.gif" width="521" height="338"></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>One side of the model should now have no faces. The inside of the model 
          is usually black as this is where no light reaches.</p>
        <p>9. Now we are going to scale the box and move it so it is on the line 
          of symetry (in this case the YZ plane). Use the select tool with the 
          Face button pressed in, except this time uncheck the 'Ignore Backfaces' 
          checkbox. Drag a selection box over the box in any view to select the 
          whole model.</p>
        <p>10. Click the Move button in the Model panel. In the panel that pops 
          up below, enter 10 in the box above the X button then press move. This 
          moves the box over 10 units. You will notice that it does not sit on 
          the line yet, but the next step will make this so. You will come to 
          realise that at this zoom level (in the 2D orthographic viewports) that 
          each grid unit equals a 20 by 20 unit area. Therefore moving the box 
          by 10 units moves it halfway through the grid boxes.</p>
        <p>11. Click the Scale button. The Scale panel will pop up below the main 
          Model panel. The last operation left the value in the Y box at 0.2 so 
          to avaid changing the Y axis again enter 1.0. Enter 0.5 into the X box 
          then press 'Scale'.</p>

        <p>12. This block represents the mid-section of the plane's fuselage so 
          we will shape it a bit better, after all a blocky mid-section would 
          look kind of boring. So Use the select tool but instead of pressing 
          the Face button in the Select Options panel, press the Vertex button 
          instead, make sure 'Ignore Backfaces' is un-checked.</p>
        <p>13. Use the Front viewport perspective and select the top left vertex 
          of the box (a vertex is a dot in the viewport it appears bigger than 
          the lines that construct the model wireframe). Because 'Ignore Backfaces' 
          is turned off the vertex toward the front and the vertex towards the 
          back in the region you selected are both selected. This is what we want.</p>
        <p>14. Use the Move tool again and click and hold in the viewport in which 
          the vertices were selected and drag the vertices up a bit.</p>
        <p>15. Do the same again with the vertices on the bottom left of the box.

        <p>16. The next step is to bring in the vertices to the back right of 
          the shape. In the top view select the vertices at the top right hand 
          corner of the shape. Move these vertices to the left a bit, bringing 
          them closer to the center of the x axis. Here is the result.</p>

        <h2><a name="Front"></a>Front of Airplane</h2>
        <p>17. Now we can start forming the front of the aircraft. Choose the 
          Select Tool and in the Select Otions panel choose Face and make sure 
          'Ignore Backfaces' if checked. In the Front viewport (remember that 
          if there is no front viewport, use the viewport caption to change one 
          of the others to a front viewport) select the two prodominant faces 
          (the ones facing you). Remember to select these faces hold shift and 
          click approximately in the centre of each face.</p>
        <p>18. Now go into the Top perspective. From the Model panel on the Toolbox, 
          choose the Extrude tool.</p>
        <p>19. In the Top viewport click and hold in an area just off to the side 
          of the model, drag the cursor down. The faces that you selected will 
          start to move down as you move the cursor down. This is called an extrude 
          operation, new faces are created in the gaps between the selected faces 
          and the faces that they were attatched to. Keep extruding until the 
          faces reach about halfway through another grid square, to stop extruding 
          just let off the mouse button. If you cannot get a good view of the 
          extrude operation as you perform it, Undo (Ctrl+Z) the extrude operation 
          and press Control on the keyboard and Left Click and drag in the viewport. 
          This pans the camera around. Notice, in the following image, the extrusion 
          to the front of the shape we had before.</p>

                take into consideration the different types of shading available 
                in the 3D viewport. Throughout this tutorial I have been using 
                Flat Shaded. This is becuase polygons are more defined in this 
                view than in Smooth Shaded; the default. Flat Shading is useful 
                in model creation whereas smooth shaded is good to see the final 
                result. To change the shading type right click in the 3D viewport 
                and from the popup menu choose Flat Shaded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

        <p>20. This new extrusion is the first part of the front of the plane. 
          We will shape it a bit now. In the Top viewport, select (with Vertix 
          and 'Ignore Backfaces' unchecked) the vertices to the bottom right of 
          the model (the ones on the extrusion that we just made). Use the move 
          tool to shift these a bit to the right to create a shallower gradient 
          than that of the line above it, i.e. creating an acute angle instead 
          of the obtuse angle it was after extrusion.</p>

        <p>21. Now deselect the moved vertices (just click in the viewport with 
          the select tool). Go into the Left viewport. The extrusion should be 
          to the right of the viewport now. Use the select tool again (with Vertex 
          and 'Ignore Backfaces' unchecked) and select the two vertices to the 
          top right of the extrusion. Move these up a bit.</p>
        <blockquote>

        <p>22. Deselect the vertices. Go back to the Front view and again select 
          (Faces with 'Ignore Backfaces' checked) the front two most prodiminant 
          faces (the two facing you in the front view). Remember to select these 
          faces hold shift and click approximately in the centre of each face.</p>
        <p>23. Go to the Top view. Extrude the faces as we did in the last extrude 
          operation; downwards, about one and a half grid squares in distance 
          this time.</p>

        <p>24. Use the select tool (Vertex and 'Ignore Backfaces' unchecked) to 
          select the vertices in the bottom right corner of the extrusion that 
          was just created, this will select both the vertex you can see and the 
          one underneath it.</p>
        <p>25. Use the Move tool to shift the selected vertice to the left, bringing 
          them closer to the centre point on the x axis.</p>
        <p>26. To add a bit more shape, I used the front view to select the top 
          left vertex on the extrusion that was just created, I moved this down 
          a bit because this is very near the tip and will give it an aerodynamic 
          look. I also moved the vertex to the top right of the new extrusion 
          down a bit in the front view. I used the Select tool with Vertex and 
          'Ignore Backfaces' checked. In the top view I also selected the bottom 
          left vertex of the previous extrusion, then used the left view to drag 
          it up a bit. Finally I selected the two top vertices at the opposite 
          end of the model (in the top view using 'Ignore Backfaces' with the 
          select tool) and moved them down a bit using the left view.</p>

                and the mouse for the actual modelling. The shortcut for Select 
                is F1 and Move is F2, these are the ones you will probably use 
                the most, but of course that depends on your work methods. See

          in the front view with the select tool (Face, 'Ignore Backfaces' checked), 
          then once again extrude them. Extrude them about half a grid box in 
          distance.</p>
        <p>27. To create the tip is easy, if you have not done so already deselect 
          the faces. Now use the select tool (Vertex, 'Ignore Backfaces' unchecked) 
          and select in the top view (or appropriate) the vertices of the new 
          extrusion. Now goto the menu and click Vertex-&gt;Snap Together (or 
          Ctrl+N) don't deselect the vertices just yet... After snapping you must 
          remember to weld (it may not always be neccessary to weld but this depends 
          on your needs), so goto the menu and click Vertex-&gt;Weld Together 
          or (Ctrl+W). You now have one vertex where four previously existed.</p>

          have also moved the bottom right vertex of the previous extrusion a 
          bit more to the left, towards the centre of the x axis.</p>

          front view to a back view if a back view is not already available, if 
          you do not know how to do this see the <a href="../Panels%20&amp;%20Windows/ViewCaption.html">Viewport 
          Caption</a> section or right click in the viewport and from the popup 
          menu choose Projection-&gt;Back.</p>
        <p>30. Now for the aid of making future modelling easier, to temporarily 
          hide sections that we are not working on we will create a new group 
          and hide it. Click on your <a href="../ToolboxGroups.html">Groups</a> 
          tab on the Toolbox. In the list box immediately below the Group name 
          on the tab you should see one group called 'Box01' by default. This

          This group contains the faces that were selected. Enter the name 'Front' 
          in the box next to the Rename box then press the Rename button. Two 
          groups are now shown in the Groups list box, MidSection and Front. Click 
          on the Front group in the list box and click the Hide button. This removes 
          the group from the display so that it is easier for use to model the 
          back of the aircraft.</p>
        <p>34. We can now model the back of the aircraft. In the back view that 
          you created in a viewport (step 29) select the two faces facing you 
          (with select tool, Face and 'Ignore Backfaces' checked).</p>
        <p>35. In the top view (or the left view whichever you prefer) extrude 
          these faces about three quarters of a grid box distance. Don't deselect 
          yet... create another extrusion in the same manner about the same distance. 
          These extrusion will form the basis of the tail. Now deselect the faces.</p>
        <p>36. Now using the select tool (Vertex, 'Ignore Backfaces' unchecked) 
          in the top view select the top three vertices down the right hand side 
          of the model and the Move them to the left a bit.</p>

        <p>37. If you have not got a Right side view visible change your Left 
          view to a Right view. Choose the select tool again (Face, 'Ignore Backfaces' 
          checked). Now select the two faces on the side of the last extrusion, 
          these are facing directly toward you in the right side view. Remember 
          to use the shifl key when selecting multiple faces, and to click approximately 
          in the middle of each face you mean to select.</p>
        <p>38. In the Top viewport, use the extrude tool on the Model tab of the 
          Toolbox to extrude these faces about three quarters of a grid box in

        <p>39. Deselect the faces. This will form the back wing of the plane. 
          Still in the top view use the select tool (Vertex, 'Ignore Backfaces' 
          unchecked) to select the top right vertex of the new extrusion. Move 
          them back a touch to create an airodynamic look, much as they would 
          look like on a commercial airliner. Do the same with the lower right 
          vertex of the same extrusion. Move it back a bit and in to the left 
          a bit.</p>
        <p>40. In the Right viewport, use the select tool (Vertex, 'Ignore Backfaces 
          checked) to select the four vertices of the new extrusion, the ones 
          that you just moved in the previous step. Don't drag a region over them 
          because you will end up selecting other vertices as well. Instead drag 
          a box around the first two, to the front then hold shift and drag a 
          box over the next two, to the back. </p>
        <p>41. Use the scale tool on the Model tab of the Toolbox, then click 
          in the Right viewport and hold, drag the mouse down to make the top 
          and bottom vertices come closer together. When you are satisfied with 
          the height between the vertices. This is called an arbitary scale operation. 
          If you wish you can move the vertices up a bit before deselecting them.</p>

        <p>42. Now we will create the back fin of the aircraft. In the top view 
          select (I'll leave you to figure out the select configuration combination 
          for this one) the two faces at the top of the model on the new extrusion 
          that was created, these are the two faces to the left of the tail wing 
          we just created.</p>
        <p>43. Use the extrude tool in the back or right viewport to extrude the 
          faces up a bit.</p>
        <p>44. Using the scale tool, perform an arbitary scale operation (mouse 
          click-hold and drag), in the top view port to decrease the width of 
          the extruded faces (they should be the selected ones). Decrease the 
          height of the section a bit as well. </p>
        <p>45. Next, move the two selected, extruded faces to line up with the 
          back of the model. Then move them to the right a bit to be closer to 
          the back fin.</p>
        <p>46. From the back view, with the same faces still selected, use the 
          Rotate tool in the Model tab of the Toolbox to rotate the faces. Do 
          this by clicking and hold in the back viewport to the right of the faces 
          then drag the mouse cursor down. The way the faces rotate in reaction 
          to the direction you drag in depends on where you originally clicked 
          to begin the operation. The markings shown in the image are just a guide. 
          This operation is called an arbitary rotate operation, that is controlled 
          by the mouse and not actual values (as would be entered in the Rotate 
          Options panel that appears upon selection of the tool see the <a href="../ToolboxModel.html">Toolbox: 
          Model</a> section for more details).</p>

        <p>47. From the back view Move the faces down and to the left a bit. Then 
          extrude them upwards, creating the back fin. Feel free to shape this 
          as you desire, using any tools you deem neccessary.</p>
        <p>48. We are now getting close to something resembling an airplane. We 
          will create another group of the back section so that if we require 
          it, we can hide it. Select the faces shown in the image below, using 
          the select tool. Goto the Groups tab and click Regroup, rename the group 
          'Tail' (do this by entering the name in the box first then clicking 
          the Rename button). </p>

        <h2><a name="Wing"></a>The Wing</h2>
        <p>49. The wing will be realtively simple, or at least, it should be by 
          now. Unhide the Front group in the Group panel of the Toolbox, do this 
          by clicking on the name of the group in the list box then click the 
          Hide button. The Hide button acts like a toggle, turning the display 
          of the group on and off depending on its current display setting (visible/not 
          visible).</p>
        <p>50. Goto the Right side view of the craft. Select the vertex indicated 
          in the image below and move it to be in a straight line with the remainder 
          of that section.</p>

        <p>51. Now, still in the right view, select the four faces that are immediately 
          to the right of this vertex that you just moved. (I'm assuming now that 
          you know what Select Options to choose).</p>
        <p>52. In the top view Extrude these faces to the right, about one and 
          a half grid boxes distance.</p>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p>53. Still in the top view use the select tool to select the vertices 
          at the back of the wing (to the top in the image above). Move these 
          vertices back a bit more to create a streamlined effect, move them to 
          the right a bit more as well as this will be the part of the wing that 
          protrudes the furthest from the fuselage.</p>
        <p>54. I finished up the wing by moving the other two sets of vertices 
          to the front of the wing (the vertices to the bottom of the wing in 
          the image above) into a position that would give a better look of aerodynamics. 
          I also selected all of the wing vertices (six in total) and scaled them 
          in the right view in height for a structure that would cut the air better 
          (if it were a real plane). Here is the final top and right views of 
          the wing.</p>

        <h2><a name="Finish"></a>Tidying Up &amp; Finishing Off</h2>
        <p>55. If you were paying particularly close attention during the modelling 
          process you would have realised that there were new faces created as 
          we went along on the side visible from the Left side viewport. Change 
          your right viewport back to a Left viewport, there are nine faces in 
          total to be deleted, so use the select tool and select the faces shown 
          in the image below.</p>
        <blockquote>

        <p>56. Just press delete to be rid of these unwanted faces. Keeping them 
          won't make any physical difference to the overall structure of the plane 
          but they add to the poly count and aren't seen so we should remove them.</p>
        <p>57. When we extruded the wings we selected four faces in total. When 
          we did the extrude operation an extra four faces were created in the 
          wing shown in the image immediately below. To get rid of these faces 
          is quite a complex operation so I will elaborate.</p>

          <p>57.1. Goto the front view.<br>
            57.2. Hide the Front group (in the Groups tab of the model panel). 
            Hide the tail group as well if you are having difficulty seing the 
            faces properly.<br>
            57.3. Using the select tool, select the two faces on the front of 
            the wing section still shown, these are shown in the image below.</p>
          <blockquote>

          </blockquote>
          <p>57.4. Press delete to remove them.<br>
            57.5. Now change to the back view and hide the MidSection group, unhide 
            the Front group.<br>
            57.6. Use the select tool again to select the two offending faces 
            which face backwards, shown in the image below.</p>

        <p>58. Because of the extrusion of the wing and the faces we deleted the 
          shading of the model will now be wrong (look strange) when we come to 
          finally give it a shading group (more about this later). So we have 
          to weld the vertices that were left behind. For every vertex between 
          groups and on the wing, select it then press Ctrl+W to weld the vertices. 
          Why is this you ask? Because in certain places in the model two vertices 
          exist where it might seem like there is only one, don't get paranoid, 
          this happens as a result of the modelling process we used in this tutorial. 
          To sort it, for every vertex selected in the image below, select them 
          individually (one at a time - I have only selected all the vertices 
          in this image to show you which ones need welded) and press Ctrl+W or 
          click menu command Vertex-&gt;Weld Together. As you do this and before 
          you start, goto Tools-&gt;Show Model Statistics and check the number 
          beside the vertices entry (at the top). You should see the number decrease 
          as you progress. I managed to get the number from 53 to 43.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><img src="../Images/BeginnersTuto/Image28.gif" width="370" height="98"></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>59. Now that the model is clean, here comes the last bit. Use the select 
          tool to select all of the faces in the model, this is done to select 
          the whole model (all groups), you could also use the groups panel to 
          individually select each group or use the select tool with the 'Groups' 
          option.</p>
        <p>60. With the model selected goto Edit-&gt;Duplicate Selection (Ctrl+D). 
          Then goto Vertex-&gt;Mirror Left &lt;--&gt; Right. You will now see 
          in the 3D view a complete aeroplane, but we are not finished yet. Deselect 
          the duplicate.</p>
        <p>61. The vertices down the middle of the model are not welded together, 
          becuase it's a duplicate of the original. The effect this would have 
          in the final shading is that a split would be obvious down the centre 
          of the model. This split cannot be seen in Flat Shaded so switch to 
          Smooth Shaded briefly to see the effect (right click in the 3D viewport 
          and select Smooth Shaded from the popup menu).</p>
        <p>62. We must therefore weld all the vertices down the centre of the 
          model. The image below shown all the vertices that must be individually 
          welded. As said before the image only shows all the vertices that must 
          be welded... <i>individually</i>. So start at the front of the model 
          in the top view with 'Ignore Backfaces' checked when using the select 
          tool so that you don't select any of the underlying vertices (remember 
          that there are vertices on the underside as well), then weld them as 
          before. Then switch to the bottom view and do the same again. The vertex 
          at the front of the plane only has to be done once as it is a point. 
          Use the back or front view to make sure you are selecting only a vertex 
          from the top <i>OR</i> the bottom side, <i>NOT</i> both. Switch to Smooth 
          Shaded while you are doing this to see the effect it is having on the 
          shading of the centre part of the plane.</p>
        <p>63. Lastly, we will assign a smoothing group to the model. So use the 
          select tool to select all of the model. Goto the groups tab of the Toolbox 
          and in the Smoothing Groups panel to the bottom of the Groups tab click 
          assign if it's not already pressed down (if should be paler if pressed 
          down) then press 1. This should clean up the last bits of shading on 
          the model. As you assign Smoothing Groups you may want to assign different 
          groups or faces to different Smoothing Group numbers. Think of the 32 
          numbers there as 'slots' for you to store your Smoothing Groups in. 
          To read more on Smoothing Groups goto the <a href="../ToolboxGroups.html">Toolbox: 
          Group</a> section.</p>
        <h2><a name="Summary"></a>Summary</h2>
        <p>This tutorial may have been hard for you to understand as it was for 
          me when I first started with MilkShape 3D, although when I first started 
          I had a decent grounding in programming computer graphics so it wasn't 
          <i>as</i> hard for me to pick up, fortunately. With perseverance, however 
          nothing in this tutorial should pose a challenge (other than my English, 
          perhaps). If you are computer litterate and are determined chances are 
          this will have been a breeze.</p>
        <p>I hope you like the model even if it is a little basic, with time, 
          experience and skill you should be able to knock something like this 
          up in minutes.</p>
