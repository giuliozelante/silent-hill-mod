<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A lot of you that have dropped 
  in on the some of the chat channels I frequent to say thanks. I am proud to 
  see such budding artist in the 3D realm and the prais is much appreciated! As 
  mentioned on the last page of <em><strong>&quot;Making a World Model for Half-Life&quot;</strong></em> 
  we will be taking the model that we just made into a <em><strong>&quot;p_&quot;</strong></em> 
  model. And if all goes well with the series, we will move on to a <em><strong>&quot;v_&quot;</strong></em> 
  model, which will require animation. Then I hope to help you make a character 
  model. download of this entire Tutorial in HTML is available at: <a

<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What is needed to complete 
  your model</strong></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As mentioned in the <em><strong>&quot;Making 
  a World Model for Half-Life&quot;</strong></em> tutorial, you will need to get 
  a copy of the Milkshape 3D program by Mete Ciragan. This can be found at the 
  following web site: <a

  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another program that we 
  will be using for the extraction of Valves and other add on packs and Modifications 
  models is called Qped. You can find this at:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another program that will 
  be useful in your creation of models is the Half-Life Model Viewer that can

<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The p_ model and what it 
  is</strong></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These models are what you 
  see in the 3rd person, as what you see another player hanging onto in battle, 
  e.g. a glock, etc. This is a required model to be able to view your model if 
  someone else happens to be using it to get you with it.There is no animations 
  that are involved in it. In actuality it should be easier than a world model, 
  because on rare occasions you see a world model that has some animations. For 
  example, take a&nbsp; look at the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;w_squeaknest&quot;</font> 
  model in <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;HLMViewer.exe.&quot;</font> You will see it has 2 animations, 
  one that never is used in HL, called <em>&quot;walk.&quot;</em> The hard part 
  about the <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;p_&quot;</font> model is that you have to have the supporting 
  biped's bones added to it, or at least a portion of it, for it to look like 
  it is attached to the model that is using it. Look at Figure 1.1 for an example 
  of our <em><strong>&quot;p_knife2.mdl,&quot;</strong></em> to see how this weapon 
  will look with a partial Skeleton that has to be used to reference the full 
  <em><strong>&quot;biped,&quot;</strong></em> (a biped is the skeleton or all 
  the joints of a model. You have to make some sort of a biped so that the mesh 
  of your model can distort to look like it is alive or in movement). of the model.Where 
  as our World Model, or <font color="#0000FF">&quot;v_&quot;</font> model, scale 
  is slightly larger than , 3rd Person, or <font color="#0000FF">&quot;p_&quot;</font> 
  model, around 1.3 instead, compared to that of 1.0, you can use the very same 
  model..Now you know why we made the World Model first! A modified version is 
  made for the ViewModel, or <font color="#0000FF">&quot;v_&quot;</font> model, 
  in which you can remove the hidden faces to reduce the polygon count. But more 
  on that latter. On with the <font color="#0000FF">&quot;p_&quot;</font> model!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In this tutorial, 
  we will be learning how to get the model so you can view the knife2 model that 
  we made in the first tutorial as a world model, as a 3rd person world model. 
  There is not much going on with it, but you can have some fun with it as I show 
  you a few tricks in how to get it ingame to look at your handy work.</font></p>
<h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Creating a Skeleton or Biped 
  for your 3rd Person Model</strong></font></h3>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will need to either 
  create Skeleton, partially that has the same joint, or bone names that the player 
  model has that you wish to see you model attached to. Here is where, if you 
  wish to not create a entire Skeleton, or Biped, from scratch, is to steal from 
  a previously created Skeleton.</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Note: If you choose 
    to create a new biped, you will have to animate each and every animation that 
    is required for a DM player in HL. There are presently 77 animations, (some 
    are two of them combined called &quot;blends,&quot; that are a combination 
    of 2 animation to make 1 animation. A blending of two separate animations 
    to effectively make it look like you are changing or morphing from one animation 
    to the next, to create an illusion of if you happen to be using the mouse 
    up, or the page up, or else you would be using the mouse down, or page down 
    in aiming, shooting, etc. This brings us to 129 total animations that have 
    to be made for scratch!).</em></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The reason behind doing 
  skeletal animations is that you do not have to make or distort your model's 
  mesh for each frame of action. Quake models used mesh animations, and this took 
  forever to do this kind of thing to hammer out a model. With Skeletal animation, 
  you only need to create the mesh, once. The skeleton is then animated and the 
  mesh is later deformed to fit the skeletons animation on the fly. This is done 
  by code that checks for the particular position of all the bones and making 
  sure that the mesh that is assigned to the proper bones are in place for that 
  particular frame of animation. e.g. if you are walking, the code checks the 
  frame of animation that is current, and places the foot where the skeletons 
  animation currently is. Some deforming has to be done, this is why some animations 
  may not be perfect, and reassignments of joints, or bones are done so the deformation 
  looks realistic. i.e. if you assign on of the fingers on a hand on the left 
  hand to the right hands finger of the same position, it will look as if the 
  finger had stretched to the tip of the bone on the right hand, causing an unwanted 
  distortion! No we do not want to create an unusual creature from the murky depths, 
  but a natural looking humanoid!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Open the &quot;<em><strong>w_knife2.ms3d&quot;</strong></em> 
  file that you created in the last tutorial, or download it from:</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><em>Note: You will need 
    Milkshape Version 1.4.0 to open the Ms3d file that is contained in the zip</em>.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of course you will want 
  to be making a new directory for this <font color="#0000FF">&quot;p_&quot;</font> 
  model and we will name the directory <em><strong>&quot;p_knife2&quot;</strong></em> 
  so as not to be confused with the <em><strong>&quot;w_knife2.mdl&quot;</strong></em> 
  that we made in the last tutorial. save this file as <em><strong>&quot;p_knife2.ms3d.&quot;</strong></em></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Lets get to work on our 
  Skeleton. I am going to be looking at a similar biped that would be used for 
  the creation of the character that we will be eventually be making. This is 
  going to be a secret for now as to how the player model is going to look.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">First off you do not have 
  to create the skeleton completely to make a <font
color="#0000FF">&quot;p_&quot;</font> you only have to make a portion of it. But 
  as mentioned before, these &quot;joints&quot; or bones need to have the bone 
  names exactly the same as the &quot;biped,&quot; or skeleton of the full character 
  model that we will eventually create.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I would like to pause here 
  a bit to show you how you can save yourself some time in the creation process 
  of a biped. Milkshape 3D has as mention in the &quot;Making a model for Half-Life&quot; 
  tutorial, has a decompile utility. This means that you can decompile models 
  that have a similar mesh build and taking the biped out of it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Create a new directory called&nbsp; 
  <em><strong>&quot;op4_knife&quot;</strong></em> to save to when we export the 
  knife for the next step.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You will be looking for 
  the op4 knife in the add on pak0 file of <em><strong>&quot;Opposing Force®&quot;</strong></em> 
  and decompiling it to see how its <em><strong>&quot;p_knife.mdl&quot;</strong></em> 
  looks like and what the bone names are called. So start up Qped and lets extract 
  it. Choose <font color="#0000FF">&quot;<u>F</u>ile-&gt;Open...&quot;<strong> 
  </strong></font>and find your &quot;pak0.pak&quot; file from the <em><strong>&quot;Opposing 
  Force®&quot;</strong></em> directory. I found mine in this directory structure: 
  <em><strong>&quot;C:\SIERRA\Half-Life\gearbox&quot;</strong></em> yours may 
  vary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Export the knife to your 
  <em><strong>&quot;op4_knife&quot;</strong></em> directory. See Figure 1.2 for 
  and example of this.</font></p>
