  <h1>Extruding Faces</h1>
  <p>Extruding faces is a primary function of most 3D<span lang=EN-GB
  style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> modelling</span> packages and it comes in
  very useful when modeling complex shapes. Extra detail on a surface can be
  achieved by extruding faces then modeling them separately.</p>
  <p>For this example we will use a simple airplane as the model in progress. When<span
  lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> modelling symmetrical</span>
  models it is common to model only one half of it then mirror it when it is
  finished in order to achieve a completely symmetrical model.</p>
  <p>1. I already have a fuselage constructed for the plane, it is only the
  left half of the model so that I can mirror it later.</p>

  <p>2. To form the wings I need to select the faces from which I want to
  extract a wing. I selected the two faces highlighted by the blue lines in the
  image below.</p>

  <p>3. To get a good view while I extrude I will use the top viewport to use
  the extract tool in. So with a good view of the selected faces, I extrude...</p>

  <p>4. As you can see this has moved the selected faces outward and created
  new faces to link them to the rest of the model. You are in essence extruding
  a face from the model. After I did this I then went on to shape the wing the
  way I wanted it. Here is the completed left side of the plane.</p>

  <p>As you can see extruding faces is an extremely useful feature. This whole
  airplane was made from a box and extruding faces, not bad for two minutes.</p>

  <p>This is the completed model with Duplicated and 'Mirrored Left-Right' left
  side, to create the right side of the plane. If you are creating a model like
  this, don't forget to weld the vertices throughout the centre of the model.</p>
