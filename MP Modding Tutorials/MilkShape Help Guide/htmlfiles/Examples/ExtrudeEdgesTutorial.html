  <h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Extruding Edges in MilkShape 3D</font></h1>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks to a very powerful 
    tool (created by MilkShape user CCCP) it is now possible to extrude edges 
    on your models created in MilkShape 3D, simply by selecting the vertices along 
    the desired edges and invoking the tool, choosing the desired options and 
    pressing OK. This small tutorial will hopefully help in using this convenient 
    tool. CCCP has also compiled a page of information about this tool available 
    at: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/c3p1models/extrude.html" target="_top">http://www.geocities.com/c3p1models/extrude.html</a>.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For the purpose of demonstrating 
    the tool, I had previously created a model of a Ford GT40 Mark 1. I will use 
    the extrude edges tool to create the wheel recesses in the car's body. Here 
    is a breakdown of the process.</font></p>

            and <strong>Z</strong> tools (under the <strong>Vertex </strong>menu) 
            when appropriate, these allow you to align vertices and will make

            useful tip is to use the Shift+Right Click, Shift+Right Click-Drag 
            key combo to deselect unwanted vertices in the 2D view ports and Alt+Shift+Right

  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. After getting a good 
    view of the vertices in question, select them in the Right 2D viewport. Please 
    note that I could have selected them in the 3D perspective viewport by using 
    the Alt+Shift+Left Click key combination and clicking on each vertex in turn 
    that forms the wheel arch, in this case however, the 2D viewport gave a better 
    view; and use of the <strong>Ignore Backfaces</strong> option meant that I 
    would only select the vertices along the wheel arch edge on the right side 
    of the model. The image below shows the selected wheel arch vertices.</font></p>
  <p align="left"> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../Images/selection.gif" width="808" height="328"></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. Invoke the Extrude 
    Edges tool through the menu command <strong>Vertex | Extrude Edges</strong> 
    (the plug-in resides in this menu by default - it can be changed using the 
    Settings button at the bottom of the dialog box). Here is a brief (or not 
    so brief) run down of the various options available.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../Images/dialog.gif" width="255" height="353"></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Coplanar</strong>: 
      The extruded edges will be an 'extension' to the faces sharing the edge 
      which is being extruded. So the surface including the new extrusion will 
      be flat, i.e. the vertices of the new extrusion will be closer to meeting 
      in the middle of the wheel arch.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../Images/coplanar.gif" width="808" height="328"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Perpendicular</strong>: 
      The extruded faces will be perpendicular to the faces sharing the extruded 
      edge, so the surface including the new extrusion will form a lip, or corner. 
      The reverse checkbox determines in which direction the lip will go.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../Images/perpendicular.gif" width="808" height="330"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Manual Offset</strong>: 
      This option, when enabled will allow you to manually type in an extrusion 
      amount. The three edit boxes under the Manual Offset group panel (shown 
      ghosted in the above image of the Extrude Edges dialog) will become enabled 
      and allow you to enter an amount of extrusion along each of the world axis. 
      For example, an amount of X: -7.0, Y: 0.0, Z: 0.0 gives the following result 
      (note that the extrusion is flush to the extruded edge because it was extruded 
      along the X axis only):</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../Images/manualoffset.gif" width="403" height="329"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Extrude only 
      Non-Shared Edges</strong>: This checkbox (when unchecked) enables the extrusion 
      of all edges between the selected vertices, for example this allows for 
      easy extrusion of the edges of a circular disk without extruding all of 
      the edges that connect with the outside edge and the center vertex, as shown 
      below (for the selection of our wheel arch this option is of no consequence 
      as it does not effect us):</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../Images/nonsharededges.gif" width="403" height="329"></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Average Edge 
      Length</strong>: This option used a divisor to determine the length of the 
      extrusion. The higher the divider the shorter the extrusion.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Specified Length</strong>: 
      Allows the length of the extrusion to be set directly. The edit box here 
      will always contain the length of the extrusion determined by the settings 
      on the rest of the dialog.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Select Extruded</strong>: 
      This option allows the user to set what is selected after the operation 
      is complete. If <strong>Vertices</strong> is selected then the new vertices 
      will be selected after the operation, and the new faces if the <strong>Faces</strong> 
      option is selected.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. I used the Coplanar 
    option (the Manual option may be a better choice but I want the resultant 
    extrusion to merge in a bit towards the center of the car). I used the <strong>Average 
    Edge Length</strong> option and set the <strong>Divisor</strong> to 8. With 
    the <strong>Vertices</strong> option set on the <strong>Select Extruded</strong> 
    option press OK. The selected vertices are then moved back along the X axis 
    by pressing <strong>Move</strong> in the model panel, then entering -7 in 
    the box above the <strong>X</strong> button on the <strong>Move Options</strong> 
    group panel. This gives the following result (this could have been achieved 
    using the <strong>Perpendicular</strong> option but doing it this way gave 
    cleaner results):</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="../Images/coplanarmove.gif" width="403" height="329"></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. With the resulting 
    moved vertices still selected I aligned them on the X axis by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X. 
    This is to make sure that the wheel recess wall is flat when it is created.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. With the vertices still 
    selected, extrude the edges again using the Coplanar option with a <strong>Specified 
    Length</strong> of -1 - remember this value for later on and <strong>Vertices</strong> 
    selected under the <strong>Select Extruded</strong> option.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Now hit Ctrl+N to snap 
    the selected vertices together (<strong>Vertex | Snap Together</strong>), 
    and then Ctrl+W to weld them (<strong>Vertex | Weld Together</strong>). Move 
    the resultant vertex back along the X axis by 1 - the value that was remembered 
    from the last step. We are moving the vertex 'back' which means we have to 
    specify a value that is the negative of the number used in the extrude dialog, 
    the negative of -1 is 1. We now have a vertex that is flush with the first 
    extrusion's vertices.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">7. Move the selected vertex 
    down a bit to match the rest of the underside edge of the car and you have 
    a finished wheel recess.</font></p>
