        <h1>Applying a Texture</h1>
        <p>Textures can only be applied to groups, they cannot be applied to individual 
          faces unless that face is in a group by itself. This example will explain 
          how to load a texture that you have created and assign it to a group 
          of your model. The groups in question are the six sides of a box, called; 
          Front, Back, Top, Bottom, Left and Right. The texture I used is the 
          one shown here.</p>

                although most modern cards can handle these sorts of textures, 
                you graphics card drivers may need apdated also.</o:p></span></p></td>

        <p>1. First of all we have to create a new material. In MilkShape 3D a 
          material is anything that applies a colour or texture map to a group 
          of faces. A material can contain a texture and colour information at 
          the same time. This will give a material with texture and a diffuse 
          colour a texture with a colour tint. Anyway, left-click on the Materials 
          tab on the Toolbox.</p>
        <p>2. Click the New button and you should see a sphere in the material 
          preview box, which defaults as grey.</p>
        <p>3. Rename the texture by clicking in the white edit box next to the 
          Rename button, type the word <i>BoxMat</i> an abbreviation of the words 
          Box Material. After entering this press the Rename button to actually 
          rename it.</p>
        <p>4. Left-click the button below the slider underneath the 'Specular' 
          button, it should currently have &lt;none&gt; on it. An open dialog 
          should appear. Browse to find your texture then open it.</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><img src="../Images/ApplyTexture/ApplyTex1.gif" width="390" height="259"></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>5. You now have a material to assign to the model. Click on the menu 
          option Edit-&gt;Select All (Ctrl+A) to select the whole model (this 
          selects all six groups). In the Materials panel make sure the BoxMap 
          material is highlighted in the white list box to the top of the Material 
          panel and click the Assign button. If the 3D perspective view is not 
          already in Textured shading mode then right click in the 3D viewport 
          and select 'Textured' from the popup menu.</p>
        <p>6. The texture is now mapped to all sides of the box but the region 
          UV coordinates are not set up properly. This means that the whole texture 
          is shown on each face instead of one coloured side with the appropriate 
          name showing on it. To fix this we will use the <a href="../Panels%20&amp;%20Windows/TexCoordEditor.html">Texture 
          Coordinate Editor</a>.</p>
        <p>7. Choose the Menu option Window-&gt;Texture Coordinate Editor. You 
          should be able to see the texture as well as the Front faces on top 
          of the texture. If you cannot see the faces then close the editor and 
          press Ctrl+A again to select all the faces. If at any point when using 
          the texture coordinate editor you cannot see faces, exit the editor 
          and select either all the faces or only the faces you desire. This image 
          shows roughly what you should see.</p>

        <p>8. Everything is quite small so enlarge the window if you have to and 
          enter a value of about 4 into the white edit box next to the 'Scale' 
          button, then press the Scale button. This is similar to a zoom function, 
          it allows you to see in more detail what you are doing. Also check the 
          Redraw box, this will automatically update the 3D view to reflect the 
          changes you make in the Texture Coordinate Editor.</p>
        <p>9. The top drop down list in this image is the Group selection box, 
          this means you don't have to exit the Texture Coordinate Editor everytime 
          you want to select another group to operate on. The bottom one is the 
          view perspective box (the direction from which you view the faces). 
          With both the top and bottom drop down list at Front choose the Region 
          tool.</p>
        <table class=MsoNormalTable border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"
   style='width:100.0%;mso-cellspacing:0cm;mso-padding-alt:1.5pt 1.5pt 1.5pt 1.5pt'>
          <tr style='mso-yfti-irow:0;mso-yfti-lastrow:yes'> 
            <td style='background:#FFFFCC;padding:1.5pt 1.5pt 1.5pt 1.5pt'> <p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Note</span></b><span
    style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>: <o:p>MilkShape 3D uses a texture 
                mapping technique called planar-mapping. This is the method used 
                for mapping textures onto faces. Planar mapping requires the selection 
                of an axis or 'plane' along which to project the texture, this 
                is why the view perspective box is provided. For example the Front 
                plane maps textures on the XY plane, the Left on the ZY plane, 
                etc...</o:p></span></p></td>

        <p>10. Draw a box roughly around the Red square in the top left the one 
          with Front in it. Then click the Remap button. As you can see setting 
          a Region creates a new area in which the limits of the faces will lie 
          within, this is a useful tool so use it often to speed things up, it 
          avoids the use of the more cumbersome Scale and Move buttons.</p>
        <p>11. In the top drop down list select the Back group. In the bottom 
          drop down list select the back view. The view has to be selected as 
          well, because this is the direction from which the texture is mapped. 
          If for example you left the bottom drop down list at Front you would 
          find that when you finish applying the map, the word 'Back' on the back 
          face would appear back to front when viewed from the back.</p>
        <p>12. Do another region around the green square with the 'Back' word 
          on it. Then click remap to remap the backfaces to sit within the area 
          you defined.</p>
        <p>13. From here on in its just a case of repeating steps 11 and 12 for 
          the remaining groups. Remember that when selecting any of the faces 
          that the viewing perspective drop down list box reads the same as the 
          group selection drop down box does. Keep creating regions for each group 
          around the appropriate part of the texture and pressing remap to make 
          them sit within the new region.</p>
        <p>Here is the final result.</p>

        <p>A box is a very simple shape and is naturally easy to map textures 
          onto. As models increase in structural complexity the assigning of textures 
          will also become increasingly complex and may require many groups. From 
          here everything else is experience, so Good Luck!</p>
