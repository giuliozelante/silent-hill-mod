  <h1>Turn Edge (Ctrl+E)</h1>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Example 1<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>Turning an edge is a very useful tool. The first example that is shown is
  from a scenario that you will arrive at regularly, its a case where turning
  an edge results in a<span style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'> <span lang=EN-GB>symmetrical</span></span>
  model which is always the best way to work in 3D. Its not strictly necessary
  but it results in a model that looks tidier and is therefore easier to work
  with.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>From this image you can see the front and perspective views of an abstract
  3D shape. On the left is the front view, in it you can see the wireframe that
  composes the 3D model that is seen in the perspective view.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>In this image you can see that I have highlighted the faces in question
  and labeled them Face 1 (yellow) and Face 2 (red) respectively. What we want
  is to make the model symmetrical, we want Face 1 to look like Face 2 (or it
  could be the opposite if you wish). What we have to do is select both
  triangles of Face 1 and perform the turn edge command.</p>

  <p><img width=498 height=219 id="_x0000_i1028"

  </blockquote>
  <p>As you can see now the wireframe view (front) shows a symmetrical model.
  The model in the perspective view however, has remained unchanged, as is the
  case when turning edges on flat surfaces such as in this example.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Example 2<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>In this example we are going to make the model look different in the
  perspective view by turning the edge of the notch in the middle of the
  previous model. First we select the two faces that compose the notch in the
  middle of the model (highlighted blue).</p>
  <blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>
  <p><img width=498 height=219 id="_x0000_i1029"
  src="../Images/TurnEdge/TurnEdge4.gif"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Once these two triangles are selected you can perform the turn edge
  command which will then make the model look like this:</p>
  <blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>
  <p><img width=498 height=219 id="_x0000_i1030"
  src="../Images/TurnEdge/TurnEdge5.gif"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This example shows that the angle at which two faces lie against each
  other determines what the Turn Edge command will produce. A solid bar was
  produced from a bar with a notch in it.</p>
  <h2><span style='font-family:Arial'>Summary<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
  <p>The Turn edge command will take the line that joins the two selected
  triangles and place it on the 2 opposing vertices. This is best seen in the
  following image.</p>
  <blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'>
  <p><img width=498 height=219 id="_x0000_i1031"
  src="../Images/TurnEdge/TurnEdge6.gif"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The Turn Edge command is a useful tool, it is useful when you have spent a
  long time creating faces then<span lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>
  realise</span> some are not as you would like them to be. The turn edge tool
  is also useful when you want to create a different shape from an existing
  one.</p>
