  <h1>Applying an Alphamap</h1>
  <p>If you want parts of your model to be transparent then you can use an
  alphamap. Areas on an alphamap where the colour is darker is where the
  material will appear less transparent. Where the alphamap is lighter the
  material will be more transparent.</p>
  <p>The example I have provided is simple but it explains all the processes
  you need to go through to get the correct results.</p>

  <p>Here we have a standard square composed of two triangles; on it is a
  texture of a monkey's face. What I want to do with it is make it
  semi-transparent, about 50% transparent. This is perhaps the easiest kind of
  transparency to achieve. So here are the steps I followed to gain this degree
  of transparency.</p>
  <p>1. When you have the texture applied to the face, load the texture into a
  paint program such as Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro (I have used Photoshop).</p>
  <p>2. We need to create the alphamap from this texture so what we do is
  inverse the colours. To do this in Photoshop, click on
  Image-&gt;Adjust-&gt;Levels. The levels box will appear. What we want to do
  is move the sliders on the gradient bar at the bottom to either end, swapping
  them around. When this is done (your picture should now look sickening) click
  'OK'. This effect can also be achieved by clicking
  Image-&gt;Adjust-&gt;Invert, or Ctrl+I.</p>
  <p>3. You should now have an inverted colour map (shown below) which you can
  use as an alphamap for your model. So save the inverted texture somewhere <span
  lang=EN-GB style='mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>(preferably</span> in the same
  directory as your model). Optionally (to reduce memory usage) you can then
  make the image grayscale by clicking Image-&gt;Mode-&gt;Grayscale. (I usually
  leave the image with inverted colours because a truly inverted colour without
  loss of colour information gives true ratio transparency; in this case
  50-50).</p>

  id="_x0000_i1028" src="../Images/Alphamap/greyscaleinvcol.gif"></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>4. Go into MilkShape 3D and click the alphamap button on the <a
  href="../ToolboxMaterials.html">Materials</a> tab in the Toolbox. Browse for
  your texture and open it once you have located it.</p>
  <p>The alphamap should now be applied and you should see the difference in
  your 3D viewport (of not select the group the material is to be applied to
  and click apply in the materials tab.</p>

          <p>This applied a 50-50 transparency (50% foreground texture - 50% background). 
            To achieve variations on this you can darken and lighten the alphamap 
            in your chosen paint package. In Photoshop use the Levels window as 
            mentioned before, and slide the slider on the white gradient side 
            closer to the darker side to get a less transparent alphamap. Slide 
            the slider on the dark side closer to the light side to get a more 
            transparent alphamap. Alternatively you can use the Transparency slider 
            below the Emmisive button on the <a href="../ToolboxModel.html">Toolbox:
            Model</a> panel, however this tends to oversaturate the final material.</p>
