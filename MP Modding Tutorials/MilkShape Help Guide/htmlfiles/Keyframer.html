        <h1>MilkShape 3D Keyframer</h1>
        <p>The keyframer allows skeletal positions in a model to be saved as keyframes 
          in the keyframer. Animation is produced by storing several keyframes 
          to the keyframer then playing them back using the controls on the keyframer. 
          Each frame need not be set, only frames where changes take place need 
          to be set by the user (these are keyframes i.e. they are key to the 
          animation), MilkShape 3D will fill in the gaps (frames). In order to 
          use the keyframer the Anim button (on the right of the keyframer must 
          be pressed).</p>
        <p>The keyframer is shown in the image below. Click the part that you 
          wish to see further information for.</p>

        <h2><a name=Slider></a><span style='font-family:Arial'>Keyframe Slider<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
        <p>The keyframe slider is useful for previewing your animation before 
          playing it. The slider has the advantage that you can slide it back 
          and forward with the mouse movement instead of pressing the Play Forward 
          and Play Backward buttons to see the animation. For selecting keyframes 
          it is only useful in smaller animations, in large animation with a lot 
          of keyframes it will be hard to pick a particular frame. This is why 
          the <a href="#Position">Frame Position Box</a> is provided.</p>
        <h2><a name=Playback></a><span style='font-family:Arial'>Playback Controls<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
        <p>The playback controls allow you to view your animation in MilkShape 
          3D. From the left the buttons are: Goto First Frame, Goto Previous Keyframe, 
          Goto Previous Frame, Play Backward, Play Forward, Goto Next Frame, Goto 
          Next Keyframe and Goto Last Frame. All of these commands update the 
          model to the current frame and the slider is also moved to the appropriate 
          frame.</p>
        <h2><a name=Position></a><span style='font-family:Arial'>Frame Position 
          Box<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
        <p>This box comes in useful when you have a lot of frames in your animation 
          and the slider does not allow the accuracy you desire in selecting frames. 
          The box will accept a whole number to indicate the frame to which you 
          wish to go, the slider and view will update to show the selected frame.</p>
        <h2><a name=NumFrames></a><span style='font-family:Arial'>Number of Frames 
          Box<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
        <p>This box allows you to enter your own value for the number of frames 
          you want in the animation. The default is 30. Most modelers choose a 
          relatively high number (depending on the number of animations the model 
          is to perform) and key in animations between certain numbers of frames 
          leaving a 10 frame (or so) gap between animations. Say for example you 
          had a Run, Walk, Jump and Shoot animation, you would key in the Run 
          animation first then leave ten frames, then key in the Walk animation 
          then leave ten frames, etc... This will be explained more in the animation 
          tutorial.</p>
        <h2><a name=Anim></a><span style='font-family:Arial'>The Animate Button<o:p></o:p></span></h2>
        <p>This is the button that enables the keyframer so you can use it. This 
          button acts as a toggle when its pressed down the keyframer is enabled, 
          when it is up the keyframer is disabled.</p>
