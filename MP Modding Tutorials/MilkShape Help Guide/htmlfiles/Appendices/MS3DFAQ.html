          <blockquote> 
            <p>When you register your copy of MilkShape 3D after the trial period 
              has run out problems are known to occur. You will generally get 
              a message asking you to wait for two minutes before starting MilkShape 
              3D up again once it has been registered. If the application does 
              not work, which is a very rare case then you should contact Mete 
              Ciragan, the author and explain the situation. Generally registration 
              problems are down to mis-typed registration codes or user names, 
              make sure to copy and paste the username and password that you were 
              sent directly from the e-mail to the registration box. See the <a href="../Panels%20&amp;%20Windows/About.html">About</a>

          <blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'> 
            <p>This is usually down to the fact that the face/s in question are 
              facing the wrong way. Generally you want all faces to face outwards 
              with an Anti-Clockwise Vertex Order. In order to correct the problem, 
              select the faces in question and then select menu item Face-&gt;Reverse 
              Vertex Order.</p>

          <blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'> 
            <p>The faces where the holes are, are facing inwards, they have a 
              Clockwise Vertex Order. To correct this go back to MilkShape and 
              right-click the perspective viewport then select Flat Shaded from 
              the pop-up menu. All faces that are black should be selected then 
              the action Face-&gt;Reverse Vertex Order should be performed. It 
              is recommended that before exporting that you perform this procedure 
              to avoid wasting time exporting models with holes in them.</p>

          <p><a name=Model3></a>Why does my background image not appear when I 
            use the 'Choose Background Image...' option?</p>
          <blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'> 
            <p>In some cases background images have to be of a dimension that 
              is a power of two and in all cases there is a maximum size of image. 
              This is completely dependant on the kind of graphics card you have. 
              Some people find that their image does not display unless it is 
              of a power of 2. I originally ran MilkShape 3D on a 3dfx Voodoo 
              3, the maximum image size I could use was 256x256 and it had to 
              be of a power of 2. Now I use an NVIDIA GeForce 2 Ti and I can use 
              any size I want (deduced from numerous tests). If it doesn't work 
              on your machine try to match some of the special cases I have just 
              talked about, trial and error is your best bet. </p>

            <p>This is a simple one, click on the 'Choose Background Image...'

          <blockquote> 
            <p>This effect can be achieved fairly easily as of MilkShape 3D version 
              1.6.3 and onwards. Here is an copy of a reply to a post requesting 
              information on how this is done.</p>
            <p>&quot;<i>This functionality was suggested to Mete (by me infact) 
              to make stuff like this easier.</i></p>
            <p><i>The way to achieve this angled look is by selecting all the 
              vertices and using the Vertex->Unweld option. This treats all vertices 
              as being for ONLY one face, i.e. all faces have three verts and 
              none are shared. It can increase the vert count but thats not really 
              a factor here. Once the vertices are not shared they have a normal 
              that represents the direction that the face is facing in and not 
              an average of all faces around the same area. If you catch my drift.

            <p>This can be for a number of reasons. First you must make sure that 
              the format of texture you are trying to import is supported by MilkShape 
              3D. Do this by checking in the drop down file type box in the texture

            <p>The texture dimensions should always be a power of 2, e.g. 64x64, 
              128x128, 256x256. The maximum size of texture you can use is dependant

            <p>The problem here is that the pre-set joint size that is defined 
              in the preferences window is too small. Select File-&gt;Preferences... 
              and then click the Misc tab. In the Joint Size box insert a higher

            <p>This is a problem often encountered by beginners (and experts who 
              forget). The solution is to make sure the joints you want to copy 
              the position of are selected before Copying the keyframe. The best 
              way to achieve this is to select the whole skeleton.</p>

          <blockquote style='margin-top:5.0pt;margin-bottom:5.0pt'> 
            <p>Pasting a keyframe does not mean it has been set as is the mistake 
              of most people with this problem. When you have your model in the 
              pose you want for that keyframe always remember to set it by using 
              the command Animate-&gt;Set Keyframe (Ctrl+K).</p>

          <blockquote> 
            <p>This is most probably down to when you selected the keyframe to 
              be copied. When copying keyframes use the Select Joint tool and 
              select <b>every</b> joint that you wish to copy the position of, 
              then use the Copy Keyframe command. Usually in a biped model this 
              is all the joints in the model.</p>

            <p>This can be due to a number of things. The first thing you should
