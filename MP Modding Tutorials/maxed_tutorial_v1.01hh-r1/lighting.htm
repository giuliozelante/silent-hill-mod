      <p>
      With this tutorial you are going to learn the basics of MaxED radiosity lighting.
      Good lighting is half of the looks of a level and
      a very essential part of Max Payne technology. Just like with other
      aspects of mapping, there's a lot to learn in lighting. Technical
      knowledge is of course important but the real key is an understanding of
      what kind of lights to place and where, to create an environment with an
      atmosphere. Luckily, the radiosity is a
      bit like pizza -- even when it's bad, it's actually pretty good :-)&nbsp;

            <blockquote> 
              <p> Let's continue working with the level you've made. Have a look 
                at the example level (lighting.zip, in the same zip archive as 
                this Help file came in), that's how it looks after adding a couple 
                of lights. We'll keep things on a practical level so can you just 
                get started with lighting and develop an understanding of what 
                you can do with it. First, We will add one piece of geometry on 
                the floor so something to cast shadows. Let's make a box...
<p>1. Hit space to go to movement mode, and
      move to inside one of the rooms positioning yourself so that you see the
      floor well.<p>2. Align the grid to the floor (grid size is up to you): In <b>F4</b>-mode,
      activate the floor polygon by pointing at it, and hit <b>A</b>. If you
      want to make sure that the grid lines match the walls, switch to <b>F3</b>-mode,
      point one of the wall corners so that it highlights, and press <b>A</b>
      again.<p>3. Now draw the box (or say, a pillar) to any shape and size you
      please and extrude it. Depending on if you had &quot;preferences/flip faces after
      mesh creation&quot; selected or not, the box is now either object-like (polys pointing
      outward) or room-like (polys pointing inward). Obviously we need to make
      it an object, so if the polys are pointing in, flip them: go to <b>F4</b>-mode,
      point at the box it to make sure it's highlighted and&nbsp; press <b> Ctrl-F</b>.
              <p>4. To use the same texture as the ceiling, you can either select 
                it from the materials menu, or just grab it from the ceiling (in 
                <b>F6</b>-mode, point the ceiling and press <b>G</b>). Since you 
                now know the basics of <a href="texturing.htm" target="_self"> 
                texturing</a> you can try for yourself and see what kind of a 
                box you come up with.
<p>5. Remember to group the box to the room: Go to <b>F5</b>-mode, <b>LMB</b>
      click the box, press <b>G</b> and <b>LMB</b> click the room it's in. Rooms are always the top-most objects in the hierarchy tree and all other objects have to be below them in some order.<p>&nbsp;
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="images/lighting1.jpg" align="center" width="500" height="375"><p>As you can
      see, simple shapes inherit much to their looks just from the way the
      texture is placed. With this texture placement it looks as if the box had
      an extruding top and bottom.<p>As lighting calls for a lamp mesh, it is the obvious choice
      for our next piece of furniture.&nbsp;Following the above sequence, make a
      light element above the door and texture it. Note that besides the color
      that you assign to a light, the actual color of the light is also affected
      by its texture; if you assign white color to a light that has a blue
      texture, the resulting light color will pretty much be blue.

      <p>When you have your light element in place, it's time to add the actual
      light. Also turn on the rendering of the lightmaps. To do that, open
      preferences and from the &quot;<b>texture display</b>&quot; -radio
      buttons, check &quot;<b>primary texture and lightmap</b>&quot;. Now you'll
      see both the texture and the lightmap on top of it.
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="images/lighting3.jpg" width="500" height="375">
      <p>
      In <b>F6</b>-mode, point at the surface of your light element that you
      want to cast light, press <b>L</b> and pick any color you like. In
      general, plain, almost white hues work well, since the light will gather a
      lot of color from both the texture of the light surface, and any
      successive surfaces it bounces from.
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="images/lighting4.jpg" width="500" height="375"><p>1. Open preferences and set
      &quot;radiosity viewport size&quot; to 32, &quot;radiosity passes&quot; to
      2 and &quot;radiosity boost&quot; to 200. Click OK. These values are
      quite enough to show the resulting amount and placing of light and shadow.<p>2. Go to <b>F5</b>-mode and press <b>CTRL-E</b>
      to autogroup all objects to the rooms they are in, in case you left
      something ungrouped.<p>3. Still in <b>F5</b>-mode, press <b>ESC</b> (to
      clear selection), switch to move mode (<b>SPACE</b>) and press <b>R</b>
      (start rendering)<p>4. Click &quot;NO&quot; when asked if you want to use
      the preview algorithm. This level is very small and with the above
      settings won't take more than couple of minutes to render on a ~700MHz
      machine.<p>
      MaxED goes to the wireframe mode after it has rendered the lightmaps, so when it&#8217;s done, switch back to texture rendering mode (F2) to see the results. The level should look something like this:
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="images/lighting5.jpg" width="500" height="375">
      <p align="left">
      Just how well you managed to get this kind of results doesn't matter, the
      important thing is that you become accustomed to how the lights work.
      <p align="left">
      Ok you've done well. I'll add one more light element and you can just
      watch.
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="images/lighting6.jpg" width="500" height="375"><p>This
      one will go to the ceiling killing a lot of the shadows. It's also a bit
      longer than the door light
      <p align="center">
      <img border="0" src="images/lighting7.jpg" width="500" height="375">
      <p>As you can see, from the room the lamps are in, shadows are now practically gone, due to
      the extra amount of light coming straight down from the new element. Since there are no light elements in the other room, the light can be seen "pouring" in through the doorway, creating a nice effect.<p>You can now use <b> NumPad /</b> to cycle
      Textures/Textures+Light/Lighting modes in the render display,
        or use the Preferences dialog. Note however, that while in small maps
        it's faster to use numpad / to cycle the modes, in larger maps the
        transition takes time and in the lack of immediate response, it might be
        unclear whether you pressed / the correct amount of times and it is
        simpler and oftentimes just quicker to open preferences (CTRL-P) and
        select the right mode.<br>
      <br>
      Also try rendering with the preview lighting. It doesn&#8217;t give you as good results, but it&#8217;s a lot faster. Start rendering as you did before, but choose &#8220;Yes&#8221; to the question about preview
      lighting and accept the default shoot amount, it's good for mostly all
      occasions.
