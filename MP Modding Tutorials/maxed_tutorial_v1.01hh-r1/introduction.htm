              MaxED Tutorial</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>MaxED</b> is Remedy's proprietary level editor, and it is an integral part of the toolset created to
        develop <b>Max Payne </b>the game. All the environments and objects in Max Payne
        have been
        fully modeled, textured, lit and scripted with MaxED.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>This document is a selection of&nbsp; tutorials and articles written
        by Remedy's Max Payne team and it is designed to help you create new
        game content with MaxED. The tutorials section will explain you MaxED
        usage from the very basics and the articles part deals with more
        advanced issues. </p>
        <p> Being very
        flexible and packed with features (mostly accessed through keyboard
        shortcuts) MaxED may at first feel a little hard to master. But rest
        assured, with some previous 3D experience and after learning just a few basic concepts, you will
        notice that MaxED is easy, fast and powerful modeler with exceptionally
        good texturing features -- and that is only the start. The true power of
        MaxED lies in the the interface to create very complex game dynamics and
        scripting.</p>
        <p>If you find something missing or hard to understand, we kindly ask you
        to take a look of the <a href="http://www.maxpayne.com/tutorials/index.html" target="_blank"> tutorials</a> that the always-devoted modding
        community has produced -- maybe you will find things better
        explained there. Consider also visiting <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/forums.html" target="_blank">3D
        Realms forums</a> where you will find plenty of help and other FAQs
        answered in the&nbsp; <i>Max Payne mods &amp; editing</i> subsection.</p>
        <p>Yours,<br>
        <i>
        Max Payne development team</i></p>
