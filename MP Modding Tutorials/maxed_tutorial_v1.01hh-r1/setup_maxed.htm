              Setting up MaxED</h1>
      <blockquote>
        MaxED is part of the Max-FX toolset. First you need to have the game
        installed as MaxED needs the game to access it's database.
        <p>To get the Max-FX tools in, insert the game CD and select <b>Install
        Max-FX tools</b>. After the installation you will have a new item in the
        Start/Programs menu called Max-FX tools under which you can launch
        MaxED. If you like, you can already open MaxED and start testing, but
        you will not be able to take your level into the game unless you do as
        described in the <b>Preparing the game for custom levels</b> section
        below.</p>
              <p>Once you start to work&nbsp; with MaxED, we recommend you to print 
                yourself a copy of <a href="quickref.htm" target="_self">MaxED 
                Quick Reference</a> document. Users with plenty of previous 3D 
                game editor experience can probably get already very much out 
                of this document and start working almost immediately. And whatever 
                your skill level is, it might be very good to briefly go through 
                all the items and descriptions to get some kind of overview of 
                all the features that MaxED has.</p>

      <h2>Preparing the game for custom levels</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Remedy has already provided you a very basic custom level, that you
        can use as a base of your own work.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Look the contents of your Max-FX tools folder. There you will find
        (among others) two folders: <b>Rasmaker</b> and <b>ExampleMod</b>. To
        get the basic level into game, you need to use the RASMaker program from
        Rasmaker folder to extract the MPM file from the ExampleMod folder.</p>
        <p>RasMaker does not have graphic UI and you need to use the <b>DOS prompt</b> or <b>Run</b>
        command from the Start menu. The actual command is:&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="fixed">Rasmaker.exe -X &quot;basic room example mod.mpm&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Assuming that you know how to use command line system, you know that
        this does not work. Naturally you need to define the paths, for example
        like this:&nbsp;</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="fixed">"D:\MAX-FX Tools\RasMaker\RASMaker.exe" -X  "D:\MAX-FX<br>
        Tools\ExampleMod\Basic Room Example Mod.mpm&quot;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Change the paths as necessary to match your system.</p>
        <p>When the command is successful, a folder &quot;data&quot; appears
        inside the folder where the Rasmaker.exe is. Copy that-directory
      into your Max Payne directory. This will give us the modified levels.txt that
        will add a new item to the game's main menu.</p>
        <p>Modify your shortcut to Max Payne the game by adding at least these
        two switches after the name. This gives you access to developer options
        and some additional keys inside the game.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="fixed">MaxPayne.exe -developer -developerkeys</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You might also consider adding -skipstartup and -window switches,
        which will make the game skip the opening animation and open the game in
        a window.</p>
        <p>When you launch the game, you will have a new menu item presented
        which is the basic room example you just copied under the Max Payne
        folder.</p>
        <p>When you have made some new content with MaxED, export your level on
        top of the example level (.ldb) inside the data folder and you can
        quickly access it from the game.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Possible problems: 
      
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b>MaxED doesn't start at all</b><br>
        Launch MaxED
      without command line switches and try out different rendering options.
      Also try out different drives for your video card.</p>
        <p><b>I decided to extract the whole database from the
      .RAS files, but now MaxED can't find the database anymore</b><br>
        You have to
      define the database path as &quot;...\Max Payne\data\database\&quot; if
      you have it fully extracted from the .RAS files.</p>
        <p><b>Abnormal program termination at startup</b><br>
        Make sure you don't have the database extracted from the .RAS files AND
      still have the original .RAS files in Max Payne -directory. MaxED doesn't
        work if it finds the database twice. Neither does the game.&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>Tips: 
      
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
      <p>If you want to, you can at this point define
      some useful settings for MaxED from Options/Local Settings. Double
      click on the value to change it. 
      
       
      
      </p>
      <p><b>AlphaTestReference</b><br>
      Changes the threshold value which the editor uses as an alpha test
      &quot;cropping&quot; value. 254 means that only pure white in alpha map is
      opaque and 1 means that only full black is completely transparent. 128
      might be a good basic value 
      
      </p>
      <p><b>Autosave interval</b><br>
      Autosaves into the system %temp% directory
      as often as you want it to. Specified in minutes. 
      
      </p>
      <p><b>SharedDBPath</b><br>
      Max Payne database path. Points to the
      directory of .RAS files or to the extracted ...\data\database\ 
      
      </p>
      <p>These will only appear when MaxED tries to
      read their values for the first time. They don't dramatically affect the
      way MaxED works, they are just in for the convenience of the user. 
      
      </p>
      <p><b>Texture directory</b><br>
      Directory where you keep your textures. 
      
      </p>
      <p><b>LevelDirectory</b><br>
      Directory where to save your .lvl files (unexported source files) 
      
      </p>
      <p><b>ExportDirectory</b><br>
      Directory where to export your level files. 
      
      </p>
      <p>All local settings are stored in the windows
      registry in: 
      
      </p>
      <p>&quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Remedy
      Entertainment Tools\Max Payne Level Editor\Local preferences&quot;</p>
