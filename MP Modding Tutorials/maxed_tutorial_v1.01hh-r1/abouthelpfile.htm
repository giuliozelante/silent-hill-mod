            <blockquote> 
              <p>OK, let's be personal... :)<br>
                Hi, my name is <a href="mailto:jim_myhrberg@hotmail.com">Jim Myhrberg</a>, 
                I'm 16 years old, I spend over 10 hours/day on my PC.... bla.... 
                bla.... bla......<br>
                But anyway, I'm the guy that sat down one day and decided to compile 
                Remedy's online tutorial for MaxED to one single HTML Help file, 
                simply because it's a 'payne' in the butt to view stuff online 
                like tutorials cause it doesn't really take like 20 min to finish 
                a tutorial like this one. The other option is to sit down in IE 
                (Internet Explorer) or some other browser and save it page by 
                page. But that takes long time, and you have to check every page 
                so you've got every example file etc. etc. etc. etc. A lot of 
                the mappers, guys &amp; girls that wants to learn how to map in 
                MaxED aren't over 18 and live in their own house and pay their 
                own bills, buy their own toilet paper... you get where I'm going 
                with this don't you? Parents aren't to happy about you sitting 
                online all day just to learn how to make maps and 'sh!t' like 
                that for some game that just looks like a waste of time... (parents, 
                who can under stand em? lol)<br>
                Believe me when I say I know what I'm talking about, both my parents 
                are like that... lol<br>
                I also work with websites and stuff , and I never have time to 
                finish everything if I should follow the times and stuff my parents 
                give me. So I just sit there and finish the most important stuff 
                that I've got to do, but I don't really do it on purpose. You 
                know how it is, you start with something, or something goes wrong 
                and you have to fix it... 6 hours can then feel like 20 min... 
                like right now, it feels like I've been working with this thing 
                for about an hour so far, I still gotta compile it to a HTML Help 
                file and stuff. But if I check the time I've been here about 3 
                hours... Now I know that's not like the 6h-20min example, but 
                that has happened me when stuff really crash and sh!t... lol<br>
                Now I've been banned a few times from the PC because I've still 
                been sitting online 4 hours after I should have gone to bed... 
                lol... Now I feel like I've almost forgotten the point of this, 
                oh yeah, just remembered again... lol<br>
                The point of this help file and the zip file that it comes in 
                with all the example files and everything (except the bigger prefabs 
                and stuff like that, that comes up to 1-10MB something, you'll 
                have to get that from the online download page, <a href="http://www.maxpayne.com/tutorials/MaxED/downloads.htm" target="_blank">http://www.maxpayne.com/tutorials/MaxED/downloads.htm</a>) 
                is to give people a very simple way of getting hold of, and using 
                <a href="http://www.remedy.fi/" target="_blank">Remedy</a>'s official 
                MaxED Tutorial, and the related example files.<br>
                Now Dearly beloved <a href="http://www.remedy.fi/" target="_blank">Remedy</a>, 
                I'm not doing this to get any profit out of it, I'm doing this 
                for, well, the point of it is above... lol... My idea of this 
                is to give it out to the modding sites, like <a href="http://www.maxpayneheadquarters.com" target="_blank">Max 
                Payne HeadQuarters</a>, <a href="http://www.3dap.com/maxpayne/" target="_blank">The 
                Deep Six</a> and others, so they can put it in their download 
                databases or what ever they fell like doing with it...<br>
                But I'm gonna contact you guys over at <a href="http://www.remedy.fi/" target="_blank">Remedy</a> 
                first, I just hope I get an answer within this month, last time 
                I contacted you guys it took about 4 weeks before I got anything 
                back... lol... I don't mean that in a bad way, I just think it's 
                good you guys have a lot of stuff to do... *I'm drooling over 
                the thoughts I'm having about MAX PAYNE 2* :)<br>
                And It'd be totally AWESOME if you guys maybe could put this up 
                in your downloads section for MaxED, and in that case you probably 
                want me to change some things on this page, and I'm gonna... lol<br>
                OK, now I think it's time I close my moth, before you guys fall 
                asleep, I talk way too much.<br>
                I hope you'll enjoy this HH (HTML Help) version of <a href="http://www.remedy.fi/" target="_blank">Remedy</a>'s 
                great MaxED tutorial.<br>

                Compiled on 07.23.2002, <strong>Content Version 1.01</strong> 
                Updated 05.04.2002<br>
                I'll just stick with the current version number of the tutorial 
                it self... &quot;HH&quot; stands for &quot;HTML Help&quot;. &quot;R1&quot; 
                stands for &quot;Release 1&quot;, because I might have missed 
                something, or there might be a bug somewhere, etc.....<br>
                I can guaranty that nothing of the content of this tutorial has 
                been edited (except the basic layout of the pages, and some info 
                about where to get the example files.). All the information about 
                how to use MaxED is the same as the version that I downloaded 
                from the site (page by page, etc. etc, but I used <a href="http://www.spidersoft.com/" target="_blank">WebZIP</a>, 
                so it was a little easier then using IE). As soon as I find out 
                about any updates to the tutorial I'll be updating this HH (HTML 
                Help) version...<br>
                If you find anything that seems wrong, with the links etc. or 
                any bugs, just email me at <a href="mailto:jim_myhrberg@hotmail.com?subject=Bug%27s/Problems%20with%20MaxED%20Tutorial%20v1.01HH-R1">jim_myhrberg@hotmail.com</a></p>

              I (<a href="mailto:jim_myhrberg@hotmail.com">Jim Myhrberg</a>) do 
              not take any responsibility what so ever for any kind of injury, 
              money loss, hardware damage, car crashes, CD-ROM Disc/Drive melting 
              or any other thing at all. You can do what ever you like with this 
              Help file, I don't care, and I take no responsibility what so ever 
              for what you or what others may or may not do with this Help file. 
              So use it at your own risk, if you happened to end up in a car crash 
              or something because of this Help file, it's not my problem, or 
              responsibility, but I would feel sad for you... :(<br>
              I can't guaranty that this Help file will not harm your PC, but 
              I've used Microsoft's official compilers etc. etc. to create it. 
              The same stuff that more or less every software developer uses. 
              And I can't also guaranty that there's no virus of any sort in this 
              file, and I take no responsibility for it if so. But if you happened 
              to find a virus in this Help file, it's probably to 99.999% been 
              infected while it's been on your PC, or the server or whatever kind 
              of system you got it from. I've checked it with Norton AntiVirus 
              2002 with the newest virus definitions available at this time (07.23.2002).<br>
